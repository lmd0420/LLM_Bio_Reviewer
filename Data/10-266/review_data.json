My main concern is that the authors stated the conclusion not standing on their statistical results. In the statistical results of this study, there was no difference between gender to spatiotemporal parameters of gait, however, the authors seem to conclude gender differences exist as like the previous related articles.  The following provides more specific comments by section:  Abstract Results: The authors stated, \"Females were found with higher total double support and cadence than males.\" but this is not supported by the statistically significant result.  Conclusion: It's unclear what refers to \"these findings\". It refers to \"no differences for gender\u201d? or refers to \"females showed higher cadence than males\"? The authors should state the conclusion more clearly and it should be based on the statistical results.  Introduction In the first paragraph, line 5: I think the authors should distinguish spatiotemporal parameters of gait (i.e., stride length or cycle time) and stride-to-stride variability parameters of gait (i.e., coefficient of variation for stride length or cycle time). The authors did not show any data on the variability of gait, so this sentence had better remove.  2nd paragraph: Main focus of this paragraph was unknown. In the anterior part of this paragraph, the authors stated the gender difference in gait parameters, but in the posterior part of the paragraph, the difference between people who have a disorder and people who did not have a disorder. With the various topic included in one paragraph, it comes difficult to understand what the authors want to discuss here, and why the authors try to compare gender differences in spatiotemporal parameters of gait.  3rd paragraph: Again, two topics are mixed. The former part is about gait and age, and the latter part is about gait and obesity. I would recommend the authors write a paragraph each topic separately.  Method Sample size: Regarding the sample size calculation, isn't the calculation shown here for the sample size calculation for the correlation analysis? Since this study mainly compared gait parameters between men and women, I wonder if the authors would be used the expected standard deviation of the gait parameters for the sample size calculation.  Equipment More explanation is needed about the measurement using the Physiology 4. What is the measurement frequency? Where and how is the sensor attached? What kind of gait parameters are obtained? etc.  Procedure I do not understand what \"Foot speed\" means. Please explain it in more detail. In addition, the gait parameters are usually expressed as the combined value of both sides of the legs, especially in gait speed and cadence. The authors had better show them.  Statistical analysis The authors are comparing groups by age and BMI, but the criteria for dividing into groups were unknown. Please clarify how the group was made.  Results Please delete the sentence like \"Independent sample t-tests were conducted to compare...\". It should be stated in the statistical analysis section of the methods.  In tables 2 to 4 please show the number of samples by gender, age, or BMI group.  Discussion In the first paragraph, lines 1-2: I don't think it can be considered a major result because it is not a statistically significant result. The authors should discuss statistically significant results first. Also, in the second and third paragraphs, the authors state insignificant results first.", "guideline_question_answers": [" Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?

The current research investigated a total of 45 healthy young adults\u2019 spatio-temporal parameters sub-classified by gender, age and body mass index. While the study was the important topic, there are some fundamental concerns to be clarified.  First, the study seemed to investigate effects of (i) gender, (ii) age and (iii) body mass index on spatio-temporal gait parameters. However, the total sample is only 45 and there seemed to be only the healthy young population included in the study. This limited sample may not be sufficient in leading any meaningful conclusion about age/body mass index effects on spatio-temporal gait parameters. There are the previous studies that have incorporated much larger samples about spatio-temporal parameters; therefore, the current study is expected to demonstrate the unique findings.  Second, the introduction can be improved by elaborating on the three separate discussions about (i) gender, (ii) age and (iii) BMI effects on gait.  Third, I wonder if there were any inclusion criteria in the study in terms of age. Were participants recruited widely from the community (e.g., targeting participation of 65+ yrs population)? The sample population seemed to be limited to the healthy and young.  Fourth, some gait parameters were not defined properly. For example, what was foot speed? Was it the maximum speed during the swing phase, the average or something else? Similarly, what was Gait Cycle?  Fifth, tables 2 & 3 should show sample sizes based on the subclassifications (i.e., age, BMI).  Sixth, what was the importance of this study if no significant differences were identified in any way? Step length or other parameters may possibly reveal gender differences if normalisation techniques were employed.", "guideline_question_answers": [" Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?
