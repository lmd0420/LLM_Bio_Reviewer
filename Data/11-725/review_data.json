Which method did you use?\"\u00a0  For dietary compliance, patients were accurately interviewed by a trained physician and dietitian to assess the habitual intake of serving of gluten-containing food per week (e.g. pasta, pizza, bread, or cookies). Compliance to gluten-free diet was defined as follows: very low = more than one serving of gluten containing food/week; low = up to one serving of gluten-containing food/week; good = no gluten-containing food/week. Then based on the three days record the g/d data of gluten was investigated.

Verma and Yeliz Serin\u2019s first report.)   Reviewers' comment:\u00a0 I think there is still confusion about how the authors calculate the amount of gluten. According to their explanations; they assessed the habitual intake of serving of gluten-containing food per week. I think they should give more comprehensive explanation. Because the per serving of gluten-containing food doesn\u2019t equal to the gluten content per serving of food. Gluten is a protein that found in foods. And not every gluten-containing food has equal protein or gluten.  How much gluten does gluten-containing food contain per serving? Does it differ from one food to another (for example, pizza, bread... etc.)?  And how much gluten is necessary to be classified as you mentioned low, good etc.?", "guideline_question_answers": []}, {"review_id": "143011", "version": "v1", "reviewer_judgement": "Approved With Reservations", "review_text": "It is a very interesting study about nutritional status in CD (celiac disease) patients on GFD (gluten-free diets) in Lebanon, with many parameters studied. However, I have 2 remarks:\u00a0\u00a0  Inclusion criteria include celiac disease patients attempting a GFD for at least 6 months. This should appear in the title of the article (the population is not CD patients at diagnosis but CD patients on GFD or attempting a GFD). This point should also appear in the abstract (Background section and Methods section). A very positive point was to evaluate the adherence to GFD of the patients included, which was high and thus reducing bias.\u00a0\u00a0 In the discussion part, some references are inadequate because they studied micronutrient deficiencies in CD patients at diagnosis, and not in CD patients following a GFD (example: references\u00a0 32, 34, 41). These references should be replaced by others, for example: Cardo A et al,\u00a0Nutritional Imbalances in Adult Celiac Patients Following a Gluten-Free Diet,\u00a0Nutrients 2021, 13, 2877. \u00a0 Concerning use of probiotics in CD, there is no strong evidence to date. For this reason, I think it is better to remove this section in the discussion: \"According to the literature, gastrointestinal symptoms can be alleviated through prebiotics intake. It has been shown that\u00a0Bifidobacterium infantis\u00a0can alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms if administered to CD patients before meals for three weeks.\u00a0This can explain the occurrence and persistence of gastrointestinal manifestations among the majority of participants in the current study\". Persistence of symptoms might more probably be explained by associated irritable bowel syndrome, or by inadvertent gluten ingestion.

The authors claim, there is no data related to this issue in Lebanon. On a general search on the web, I did not find any related articles from Lebanon. Hence, I appreciate the authors for paying attention to the nutritional status of celiac patients living in Lebanon. However, I have multiple doubts that I am summarising below:  Method   In the Selection procedure part: In the \u2018exclusion criteria\u2019 the authors mentioned that they eliminated patients with malnutrition. But in Table 2, they assessed the risk of malnutrition in the patients with malnutrition. Please clarify it. \u00a0 The line of measurements: \"Weight and height were measured using automated scale and stadiometer. Body composition including body fat, lean body mass, and visceral fat was assessed using Bio-impedancemetry body composition analyzer (BF-511, OMRON)\" Please explain the standardization of measurements. \u00a0 Laboratory value:\u00a0The authors mentioned the collected data from three different centers. So, I think, the normal range of parameters could be changed. How did the authors standardized the laboratory results? \u00a0 Food-related behaviors and GFD dietary adherence: \"Across the three-day food records, patients presenting a consumption between 3 to 10 g of gluten per day were considered as non-adherent\"\u00a0In this line, please explain how you calculated gluten intake from the diet record? Which method did you use? \u00a0 Food record calculation: The authors showed the energy and nutrient intake in Tables 4, and 5, but they don't explain how they calculated this parameter from the diet? Which program did they use for the calculation? \u00a0 Statistical analysis: The authors did not mention the normality of the data set. How did they decide the normality test like (t-Test) without checking normality? \u00a0 Please also mention the full form of the SPSS first then give its abbreviation in the brackets e.g., XXX (SPSS)  Results:   In data with a statistically significant difference, please indicate under tables that: 1) Which test did you use and 2) The cut of point of significant P value (like p<0,05 or 0,001).  Discussion:   The discussion part contains multiple repeats of the results. On the other hand, The authors haven't interpreted the result (Like How, and why ..). For example: What are the factors that influenced adherence to GFD in Lebanon? Please after comparing the results with other studies, also give original comments related to your data. \u00a0 Please first write the whole explanation of this term \"P-E malnutrition\" (Protein-energy malnutrition) \u00a0 \"In\u00a0our study, the most commonly used DS was vitamin D and the least used one was prebiotics\"\u00a0The authors mentioned prebiotics, I think it was written by mistake. Please clarify this term whether probiotic or prebiotic? \u00a0 Villous Atrophy takes place in the small bowel only, no need to specify its location small bowel. Alternatively, the authors may write, partial to total villous atrophy. (First line of the main introduction) \u00a0 The first line of the Selection procedure contains results (February to July 2018). Please shift this in the results section.
