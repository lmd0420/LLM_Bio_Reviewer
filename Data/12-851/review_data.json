The aim of the study was to identify (determine) the prevalence of good ODS knowledge and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal services at a Thai community hospital.  Abstract:  Well structured and is a summary of the body of the manuscript.  Key words are missing - obstetric danger signs  Introduction:  paragraph -2 the statement..\"differs among countries, ranging from 23.8 deaths per\u00a0 100,000 live births in the US to 442 deaths per 100,000 births in Africa\". The authors chose to give a MMR lowest starting with USA - why not start with the country (ies) with the lowest MMR (<5/100,000) e.g. from a publication \"Trends in maternal mortality 2000 to 2020: estimates by WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, World Bank Group and UNDESA/Population Division\".  Paragraph 4 - there are several statements in this paragraph that need to be supported with references (sentences 2,3,4,5).  Results:  It would be more informative if Table 1 is about the sociodemographic, obstetric data of participants.  Discussion:  Is based on results of the study.  Conclusion:  Is derived from the results and discussion of the study.

Subpopulations characterized by an age below 20 years, limited educational attainment, and reliance on familial or peer networks as their primary information sources demonstrated significantly diminished levels of knowledge. Furthermore, this investigation highlighted the frequent oversight of critical indicators of preeclampsia, such as visual disturbances, epigastric discomfort, and convulsions, by the participants. This underscores the scope for healthcare professionals and governmental bodies to implement precise interventions to improve this situation.\u00a0  From my perspective, this paper offers enhanced insights into the landscape of pregnancy care within rural regions of developing countries. Moreover, it highlights a targeted area for potential development.\u00a0  There is, however, one aspect requiring further explanation within the Methodology section.\u00a0  1. what is the rationale behind establishing the threshold for \"good knowledge\" at 75%?\u00a0  The derivation of this specific percentage warrants further clarification.", "guideline_question_answers": [" Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?
