In general, the manuscript captures the details of the study design and implementation of the project. All the sections of the manuscript are well written and concluded, although several limitations exist, and it has been presented in the manuscript. The study is of sound design and clear practical and clinical interest, and I suggest accepting this article with minor revisions. \u00a0 Following are the minor comments:  Abstract:  Background: The authors have mentioned aims; either change the subheading to aims and add another subheading as background or write an introduction of the study. \u00a0 Results: Kindly mention the statistical significance.  Methods:  Is the study conducted in a Pakistani subpopulation or a Pakistani population?\u00a0  Results:  The description in the results section is a duplication of tables and figures. Kindly avoid the repetition of data that is already presented in the tables and figures.  Discussion:  Kindly avoid writing results in the discussion; the authors can mention the significant difference. \u00a0 Write future recommendations.

I would also like to compliment the authors on a well-conducted study that is very relevant during the current pandemic.  The authors have made an effort to conduct a KAP study on the public in Pakistan to evaluate their response towards COVID-19. They conducted a survey using 1120 people for data collection and also ran the Student's t-test and ANOVA after the data collection. They concluded that female\u00a0participants in the study had a higher awareness regarding the SARS-CoV2 pandemic and also found out that people generally had good awareness\u00a0about hand hygiene methods.  I only have a few suggestions to help improve the quality of the paper:  Please include a power of the sample part/discussion. Although the investigators have taken a sample of 1120, it would be a good idea to run a power of the sample test to demonstrate the population this sample would represent. \u00a0 Please include a few points of collecting information online in the limitations section. Each study has its own limitations and online surveys generally have their own limitations and bias. Kindly elaborate on this in\u00a0a separate section.  Also, you may find the following studies helpful to add to your discussion. The reason for using these studies is they are relevant to your paper and also would help you add to the discussion and limitations sections as both are online surveys on very\u00a0closely related topics that have been published in high-impact journals.\u00a0  Marya et al.,\u00a020211:\u00a0This study focuses on what measures are being taken to curtail the spread of COVID-19 by dentists to ensure no contact spread or cross-contamination occurs. \u00a0 Albargi\u00a0et al., 20212: This is a very important paper that highlights the attitude of the patients in many situations where they do not divulge proper information regarding their COVID-19 status. Again, this paper is very important in demonstrating the attitude of the general public towards COVID-19.
