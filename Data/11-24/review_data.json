Here are some comments for improvement. I hope these comments are useful!  Title: your study aims to measure willingness and hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccines among health care practitioners (HCPs) in Saudi Arabia. However, \"willingness\" is conspicuously absent from the title; I suggest adding the willingness to the title.  Introduction\u00a0\u00a0  Due to massive changes in the number of cases every day, mentioning the date you got the statistics increases the accuracy for the readers.\u00a0 The problem statement in the introduction needs to be enriching more by mentioning:\u00a0  The impact of COVID-19 on HCPs by presenting governmental statistics and previous studies\u00a0\u00a0 More international and national literature on hesitancy and willingness of receiving the vaccine\u00a0\u00a0 The motive to conduct this study in particular if we consider the high percentage vaccination rate in Saudi Arabia and how the compensation mechanism of HCPs who are declining to receive the vaccine is affected, as they are able and trained to protect patients by using the safety compliance behaviours and adhering to PPE.

INQUIRY: The Journal of Health Care Organization, Provision, and Financing, 58, 1\u20136\u201d.\u00a0  Methods\u00a0  In the Participant's\u00a0part, you mentioned \u201cAll adults (>18 years of age) currently working in healthcare facilities in KSA\u201d while your investigation is among HCPs! \u2026This may confuse the readers.\u00a0 In the\u00a0Measures\u00a0part, you wrote \u201cwe piloted the survey with nine HCPs currently practicing in KSA to assure the clarity of the questions and to evaluate the face and content validity of the scale on the targeted population\u201d, did you mean pre-test? Because you examined the face and content validity, however, the pilot study investigates the reliability of the scale by Cronbach's alpha, and the minimal size to conduct it is 30 participants. Please See \u201cSekaran, U., & Bougie, R. (2016). Research methods for business: A skill-building approach. John Wiley & Sons\u201d.\u200f\u00a0  Results\u00a0  You wrote \u201cWomen were more hesitant to receive the vaccine (47.3%) compared to men\u201d. While Table 2 shows the willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccines. There is a difference between willingness and hesitancy. I would change this to \"Women were less willing to receive the vaccine\".\u00a0  Discussion\u00a0\u00a0  Well written and interesting, however, it is better to focus on the conspiracy theories in your introduction to enrich your problem statement in this study.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is better to add the limitations and future studies in separate parts after the discussion.\u00a0  Lastly, please revise the manuscript for flow and English language edits and update any references\u00a0  Again, thank you for your work, and good luck.\u00a0\u00a0 MAG", "guideline_question_answers": [" Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?
