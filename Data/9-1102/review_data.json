These two variables are not appropriate in this context, since the methodology section limits the study to children 6-59 months.  Discussion:  The authors don\u2019t discuss thoroughly the differences between their findings and the literature:  For example:  Age of the child was the only factor significantly associated with anemia among children. What could have been the confounding factors? \u00a0 High prevalence in other studies could be linked to differences in the study population and wider population coverage since most utilized nationally representative data such as DHS data. What are these differences? \u00a0 After the statement of high prevalence in other studies, one would expect that the authors would cite those studies. Instead, they mention Ayoya et al. and  Pita et al whose findings do not reflect high prevalence of anemia.   References:  Reference 2: is related to the Tanzania DHS, not to a WHO report. Therefore, the DHS is not the primary source of the definition of anemia, but only used it.  Reference 3: This policy brief focuses on women of reproductive age, not on children 6-59 months of age.

Over 50% of anemic children live in low- and middle-income countries 12. There is also a variation in anemia prevalence within low- and middle-income countries; Repetition of sentence  Under study design and setting  No need to give district profile, better to shift under introduction. \u00a0 Villages were randomly selected from a random sample of wards. I think the study was done in both urban and rural areas, so while using, use both village/wards. \u00a0 How many villages and how many children from each villages/wards were selected is not clear. Also author has mentioned that the survey was done in villages, then wards also mentioned, is it a rural ward or urban, whether urban/rural children were selected is not clear. If so, how these children were selected from urban and rural areas were selected need to be mentioned. \u00a0 Proportionate sampling should be done in order to give equal representation.  Under Study population, sample size and sampling-   It is mentioned that children whose mothers were not available on the day of data collection were excluded from the study as it was not possible to verify child information if next in kin or neighbor was interviewed. But in next para, it is mentioned that If the child\u2019s mother was not at home, the research team visited the house for a minimum of three times before declaring that the participant could not be reached. This is not matching with above statement. \u00a0 Ethical para should be written before analysis. \u00a0 Why underweight prevalence is not given when weight has been measured. \u00a0 In table 1, age of child mentioned is 6-26, pl correct 6-23. \u00a0 Table 2, Time at complementary feeding, correct as age at CF. \u00a0 While selecting reference category, positive variable should be consider as reference. \u00a0 Adjusted analysis, which variables were adjusted in regression is not clear, which variable was removed first should be mentioned.  Under discussion  Prevalence in this study is similar to 38.8% among under-five children in Haiti, but higher than 26% in Cuba. The low prevalence in Cuba was associated to food-fortification interventions among other strategies. \u00a0 Sentence need to rewrite properly\u00a0 such as study by -----\u00a0 observed 39% prevalence of anemia among under 5 year children in Haiti, while study by -------- observed lower (26%) prevalence of anemia in Cuba which may be due to food fortification being implemented among this study population. This practice could be one of the factors that leads to poor anemia status in children, sentence is not correct it is not poor anemia status but low hemoglobin levels. \u00a0 Mothers of children aged 6\u201311 months in Australia did not receive quality anemia care, particularly nutrition advice about healthy foods and the minimum acceptable diet to the care givers- this should not be mentioned here as this study is not in Australia. \u00a0 The high prevalence of anemia among infants in this study is of concern. Interventions such as iron supplementation, food fortification and dietary diversification and management of childhood illnesses in this setting should be targeted towards mothers and children less than two years. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of anemia by sex of the child in this study which is consistent to findings from other studies- there is no continuity of statement first sentence should deleted as it is there in last para. \u00a0 Sentence writing needs to be changed, should take help from English speaking person who can write fluently. \u00a0 From the study, no other factors except age of child was observed significant, other factors such as type of house, drinking water facility sanitary latrine, morbidities in previous\u00a0 fortnight or one months if studied would have given more information, no new information /variable has been found or studied.  Under conclusion  Children in this age group were more likely to be anemic compared to those aged 24\u201359 months-this is of no use in this para first sentence itself is explanatory. In conclusion one has to mention that there is a need to explore other factors contributing to anemia as\u00a0 IFS supplementation, morbidities during previous fortnight, sanitary latrine use and mothers hemoglobin status. In recommendation, it is mentioned IFA supplementation, but whether these children were supplemented IFA has not been studied although this is universal program. So recommendation should also be based on the finding of the study. \u00a0 Spelling of complementary feeding should be checked.  In general  Discussion needs to be rewritten properly with continuity of sentence.
