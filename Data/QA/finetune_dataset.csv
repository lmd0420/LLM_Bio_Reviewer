Abstract
(revision)
Background: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker
17 Nov 2023
muscular dystrophy (BMD) are allelic disorders caused by mutations in
the DMD gene. The full mutation spectrum of the DMD gene in version 2
Indonesian patients is currently unknown. Mutation-specific therapies
(revision)
are currently being developed, such as exon skipping or stop codon view view
07 Feb 2023
read-through therapy. This study was conducted with the aim of
identifying the mutation spectrum of the DMD gene in Indonesia to
version 1
guide future development and application of feasible therapeutic
07 Feb 2022 view
strategies.
Methods: This study is a cross sectional study that enrolled 43 male
patients with a clinical suspicion of DMD or BMD. Multiplex ligation- 1. Teguh Haryo Sasongko , Perdana
dependent probe amplification (MLPA) reaction was performed to
University-RCSI, Serdang, Malaysia
screen for the common mutations in the DMD gene.

Methods: We performed a cross-sectional, analytical study in 415 University of Science and Technology,
singleton pregnant women who visited the antenatal clinic at Wang

Saphung Hospital, Loei, Thailand. A well-trained research assistant
interviewed all participants using the data record form containing 2. Natnita Mattawanon , Chiang Mai

ODS. The most recognized ODS was vaginal bleeding whereas the
least recognized ODS during pregnancy was convulsion; the least
recognized ODS during labor and delivery was retained placenta.
Multivariate regression analysis showed that the predictive factors of
good OBS knowledge included a higher education level, maternal age
of at least 20 years, and having medical personnel as a source of
knowledge.

Conclusions: In a rural setting of Thailand, two-thirds of pregnant
women had good ODS knowledge. Identifying those at risk for fair
and poor ODS knowledge and prompt mana and answer the following question: Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?",Yes
