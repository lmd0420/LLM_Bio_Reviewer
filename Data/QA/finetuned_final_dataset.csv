Abstract
Background: Activity monitoring is a necessary technique to ensure version 2
stroke survivors’ activity levels in the hospital are within optimal levels
(revision)
as this is important for enhanced motor recovery. However, this could

Introduction
Strokeisoneoftheleadingcausesofdeathanddisabilityworldwide.1TheAmericanHeartAssociationhaspredictedthat
2.58 million people will have suffered a stroke by 2047 in Europe alone.2 Functional impairment following acute
illnesses,suchasstroke,frequentlyhasnegativeconsequences,includingsensory,motor,psychosocial,cognitive,and
sexualdysfunctions.3–6Duetotheseimpairments,strokesurvivorshavesignificantlyreducedactivitylevelsfroman
earlyphase.7
Theimportanceofbeingactivefromanearlyphaseiswell-establishedinstrokesurvivors.Theevidenceforfunctional

levelsofinactivityandadecreasedrateoffunctionalrecovery.12Forthisreason,specialinteresthasbeenplacedto
exploretheamountofactivitiesinstrokepatientsduringtheearlyphase.13
Behavioural mapping is a well-known observational method that can be used for recording and observing various
behaviours.14 It allows researchers and clinicians the opportunity to collect, analyse and represent information in
resourcefulways,whichhelptodeterminehowone'senvironmentmayinfluencetheirbehaviour.15Itisaneffective
tooltorepresentbehaviouralpatternsinanylocation.16,17Behaviouralmappinghasalsobeenusedforassessingpatients'

Eligibilitycriteria
AllthestrokepatientsadmittedtothewardwerescreenedfortheeligibilitycriteriafromJuly2020toNovember2020.
As this was a pilot study, we conducted a time-bound design. We included caregivers of stroke patients affected
with the supra-tentorial lesions, aged between 18 and 80 years, medically stable with no other comorbidities and
who could functionally communicate. We excluded caregivers of patients who underwent surgery and with other
impairmentslikefractures,musculoskeletal,cardiovascular,neurologicalandotherchronicdiseasesthatcouldaffect

Theaimofthisstudywastocomparetheobservationsmadebyphysiotherapistandcaregiverstocapturethepossibilityof

thatafamilycaregiverhashighintensityroleinthehospitalastheyhavetomultitaskbothphysicallyandmentally.27
These roles make it challenging for them to tend to additional work besides situations associated with illness and
dependencyofthepatientduringthehospitalstay.28Additionally,evidenceshowsthatcaregiversofacutediseaseslike
strokehavemorecompoundedsituationsduetothesuddenchangeinadaptationrequiredcomparedtochronicdiseases.29
Anotherreasoncouldbethechangeincaregiverofthepatientduringtheobservationday.Thereplacedcaregiverwould
have not received the entire instructions from the previous caregiver leading to loss of vital information regarding
the observations. Hence, the new caregiver might not have understood the procedure adequately and did not record
theactivitiesdiligently.Further,althoughweusedpicturesalongwithwordstodepicttheactivitiesinthelogchart,

solution. For this reason, I believe these findings should be considered for indexing. However, I would
like to recommend significant modifications to enhance the scientific rigor of the study. The
current results are presented too strongly given the design and sample size. I suggest toning
down the findings, emphasizing the pilot and feasibility testing component of the study, and
engaging in a critical discussion on how these results can inform the design of caregiver-
monitored activity logs during early-phase stroke rehabilitation.
Title:
○ Consider adding ""Pilot"" to the title due to the sample size.
Abstract:
Well-written, minor suggestions:
○ Consider adding ""early phase"" before ""hospital settings"" to distinguish from outpatient
rehabilitation.
○ Insert ""across one day"" before ""every 15 minutes"" for clarity.
○ Include brief demographics for physiotherapists as participants.
Introduction:
Paragraph 1:
Please incorporate stroke statistics specific to India to substantiate the study's relevance. Utilize
percentages to illustrate the impact, particularly when stating that ""stroke survivors have
significantly reduced activity levels.""
○ Define ""early phase"" at the outset to enhance the paper's readability.
Paragraph 2:
Page 9 of 21F1000Research 2022, 11:1227 Last updated: 10 NOV 2023
○ Expand on the benefits of increased activity during the acute phase of stroke recovery and
delineate the factors that limit activity, especially in the post-acute phase.
Paragraph 3:
○ Briefly talk about the different tools used for behavioural mapping such as video recording,
checklists, wearable devices etc., with a brief discussion on pros and cons for each method.
Please justify why you selected checklist/log.
Methods:
Inclusion criteria:
○ “Functionally communicate” has been used twice in the paragraph.
○ Include the inclusion criteria for physiotherapists, specifying their level of expertise (e.g.,
trained neurophysiotherapists, novice clinicians, experienced clinicians) to provide context
on their participation and qualifications in the study.
Outcome:
○ Elaborate on the process of developing the activity log, specifying whether the validation
involved face validation or content validation, to enhance the clarity and rigor of the log
development.
○ Specify whether the testing involving 20 stroke patients was related to assessing the
practicality and usability of the log. This clarification will provide a better understanding of
the purpose and focus of the testing phase.
○ Finally, explain why exercise was categorized separately from therapies in the activity log.
Given that therapies often encompass exercise in the early phase, clarify the rationale for
this distinction and consider discussing how this categorization may have contributed to
any discrepancies observed between physiotherapists and caregivers.
Procedure:
○ Clarify whether the intern-to-patient ratio was 1:1 or if the intern monitored more than one
patient on a particular day. Specify the procedure for patient monitoring when the intern
had to take a break.
○ Indicate whether caregivers were provided with reminders or prompts every 15 minutes
during the monitoring process.
○ Provide a rationale for selecting only one working day for agreement testing.
Statistical Analysis:
○ Due to the limited sample size in this study, it is important to provide a justification for the
chosen sample size. Include information regarding whether a power analysis was
conducted.
○ I believe the study lacks sufficient statistical power for utilizing multi-rater kappa, a concern
that is indeed emphasized in the discussion. It might be worth considering excluding these
specific findings.

Results:
○ Integrate relevant details about the physiotherapists into the tables or corresponding
paragraphs within the Results section.
○ Organizing the kappa agreement according to the three domains of activities in Figure 1
would be beneficial. This would offer insights into the level of agreement within each
domain, allowing for a comparison of agreement quality across the domains.
Discussion:
Overall, the authors effectively emphasize the feasibility of utilizing caregiver led activity logs and
underscore how the design of the activity log can impact agreement. However, enhancing the
discussion through a more critical comparison with existing studies would further bolster the
strength of the argument.
Here are some suggestions for the discussion:
○ Draw parallels with the fundamental concepts of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)
and elaborate on how periodic reminders every 15 minutes could have impacted the
reporting within this study.
○ Compare the role of caregiver burden and recall burden in subjective reporting studies
conducted in similar and other clinical populations.
○ Address the learning curve associated with reporting multiple activities by caregivers. The
limited reporting duration in this single-day study may not have allowed caregivers to fully
grasp the intricacies of reporting various activities, especially if a change in caregivers
occurred during the day.
○ A discussion on alternative activity tracking methods, such as wearable sensors, should
have been included.
○ Include a discussion of the rationale behind selecting specific activities, particularly during
the initial phase, and its influence on the reporting process. For instance, considering that
physiotherapists were unable to access the bathroom area, consolidating toileting-related
activities into a single category could ensure equal reporting opportunities for both
physiotherapists and caregivers. Likewise, it is anticipated that patients would undergo
clinical monitoring and testing early in their recovery phase. Future studies may consider
incorporating this aspect into the activity log to mitigate discrepancies related to this
particular activity.

Thank you for this suggestion. We have added the prevalence data from India and the
percentage to the statement. This brings in more clarity to the given information.
Early phase has been defined as suggested. Thank you
We appreciate this suggestion to emphasize the importance of being active and the same
has been added.
We agree that the details would give a better insight. We have added more information
about the different tools used.
1. Methods:
Inclusion criteria:
“Functionally communicate” has been used twice in the paragraph.
Include the inclusion criteria for physiotherapists, specifying their level of expertise (e.g.,
trained neurophysiotherapists, novice clinicians, experienced clinicians) to provide context
on their participation and qualifications in the study.
Thank you for the suggestion. We have used it twice for two different population. The first
one refers to the eligibility in stroke survivors and the second mentioning refers to their
caregivers.
We are obliged to rectify this. The same has been added in the methods section.
1. Outcome:
• Elaborate on the process of developing the activity log, specifying whether the
validation involved face validation or content validation, to enhance the clarity and rigor of
the log development.
• Specify whether the testing involving 20 stroke patients was related to assessing
the practicality and usability of the log. This clarification will provide a better understanding
of the purpose and focus of the testing phase.
• Finally, explain why exercise was categorized separately from therapies in the
activity log. Given that therapies often encompass exercise in the early phase, clarify the
rationale for this distinction and consider discussing how this categorization may have
contributed to any discrepancies observed between physiotherapists and caregivers.
The author would like to thank the reviewer for these suggestions. We have added content
validation of the log chart to bring in more clarity and the objective of the testing.
We appreciate the suggestion and have added the same. However, in our opinion, these
details would better suit in the manuscript pertaining to the development of the activity
log chart.
1. Procedure:
• Clarify whether the intern-to-patient ratio was 1:1 or if the intern monitored more
than one patient on a particular day. Specify the procedure for patient monitoring when the
intern had to take a break.
• Indicate whether caregivers were provided with reminders or prompts every 15
minutes during the monitoring process.
• Provide a rationale for selecting only one working day for agreement testing.
Thank you for the valuable suggestion. This will help give more details about the
procedure. We have edited the same.
We have added the suggested information. Thank you.

We are obliged to rectify this. The same has been added.
1. Statistical Analysis:
• Due to the limited sample size in this study, it is important to provide a justification
for the chosen sample size. Include information regarding whether a power analysis was
conducted.
• I believe the study lacks sufficient statistical power for utilizing multi-rater kappa, a
concern that is indeed emphasized in the discussion. It might be worth considering
excluding these specific findings.
We agree with the reviewer. We did a power analysis and the same has been noted in the
statistics and results part of the paper. We did not calculate the sample size as this was a
pilot study.
We are obliged to rectify this and have removed the same from the manuscript.
1. Results:
• Integrate relevant details about the physiotherapists into the tables or
corresponding paragraphs within the Results section.
• Organizing the kappa agreement according to the three domains of activities in
Figure 1 would be beneficial. This would offer insights into the level of agreement within
each domain, allowing for a comparison of agreement quality across the domains.
We are obliged to rectify this. The same has been added in the text of the results section.
Thank you for the suggestion. In our opinion, arranging the items according to the
descending order brings in readability and clarity. However, the suggested information has
already been added in the text section.
1. Discussion:
Overall, the authors effectively emphasize the feasibility of utilizing caregiver led activity
logs and underscore how the design of the activity log can impact agreement. However,
enhancing the discussion through a more critical comparison with existing studies would

consider incorporating this aspect into the activity log to mitigate discrepancies related to
this particular activity.
Thank you. We appreciate the suggestions put forth for our discussion.
This is a very good point to add. The authors appreciate the reviewer for the suggestion.
We have added details of the same.
Thank you for the suggestion. The role of caregiver and the burden has already been
discussed.

Summary
Thank you for the invitation to review this paper. The paper might provide evidence about an
alternative option to address activity monitoring in the clinical setting by caregivers (especially in
some activities such as bathing and dressing), as this could be time-consuming for healthcare
professionals. However, the research methodology and the small sample size in the paper might
result in a lack of credibility and validation of the findings. The details of the comments are listed
as follows:
Introduction
1. Please provide more information about the stroke status and stroke survivors in India since
the study was conducted there.
Eligibility criteria
1. Please list the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the participants to help readers better
understand this section.
Outcome
1. Please clarify the specific activities included in the physical, cognitive and social
components.
2. Please describe the log chart’s validation process and provide more information about the
Page 15 of 21F1000Research 2022, 11:1227 Last updated: 10 NOV 2023
experts.
Procedure
1. Please clarify if the caregivers and physiotherapists received the same training about using
the activity log chart to ensure activity marking consistency during the implementation.
2. A single-day observation of activities among 17 stroke survivors might not provide enough
evidence and draw a solid conclusion for the study. Plus, behavioural mapping is a
subjective process that can lead to variability during observations.
Results
1. In Figure 1, it’s better to categorise all the recorded activities under the three components
to help readers better understand “the agreement of activities under physical, cognitive and
social domains were 42, 38 and 43%, respectively”.
2. I suggest analysing the factors that cause the inconsistency of agreement between
caregivers and the physiotherapist, such as the physiotherapist who have received
professional training and better understands different activities, or whether the caregivers’
educational background will lead to the deviation of observation.
Discussion
1. “Both the physiotherapist and the caregiver did not complete all observations” implies that the
study’s observations were done only on a single day is not enough to conclude.
2. As some of the toiletry activities were monitored only by the caregivers, there is still a
potential for caregivers to perform behavioural mapping of stroke in the clinical after
clarifying and addressing the factors that caused the discrepancy of agreement between
caregivers and the physiotherapist.

This is a simple study design that asks an important question. Specifically, the authors compared
the activity monitoring of stroke survivors by caregivers and physiotherapists in a hospital setting.
The amount of activity performed by stroke survivors early after stroke may affect long term
recovery, thus activity monitoring by caregivers can provide an alternate means of tracking this
measure. The authors found a 60% agreement between the physiotherapists and the caregivers,
using Kappa statistics. The study design has some limitations which are explained by the authors.
Minor comments:
1. The second sentence in second paragraph of introduction is awkward. Are you trying to say
there is evidence that recovery happens rapidly in the acute phase? Please reword.
2. Last sentence in introduction should say amount of 'activity' not 'activities'.
3. Remove the word 'By' at the beginning of the first sentence in the fourth paragraph of
introduction.
4. In the eligibility section, you use the word 'supratentorial', so only cortical strokes included?
Please clarify.
5. Procedure section: change sentences to, 'patients and caregivers were given explanations
about the study'.
I approve this study as is, with the changes noted in the minor comments section.

Summary
Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper. Overall, the paper tackles an interesting topic,
which is comparing the activity monitoring of stroke survivors by physiotherapists and caregivers.
While this is a relevant topic and has some merit since caregiver monitoring can potentially be
cost-effective and time efficient, however, there are some major concerns that I would like the
authors to clarify. More specifically, regarding the methods used. The authors only used 1 day,
although I don’t agree with 1 day being a valid measurement period for 17 stroke survivors. The
authors need to strongly justify this, especially due to the subjectivity of rating by both the physios
and caregivers and the experience of the caregivers in using the rating tool. In addition to this,
there is missing data on observing (i.e. toileting, bathing, testing). The hypothesis of the authors
also assumes that caregivers will be there to monitor the patients all day around, which is not
always possible.
Abstract
○ The first line of the conclusion ""There was moderate agreement between the physiotherapist
and caregiver for activity monitoring of stroke survivors"" is rather a result than a conclusion. I
suggest the authors rephrase the conclusion to conclude the overall outcome of their study.
Page 18 of 21F1000Research 2022, 11:1227 Last updated: 10 NOV 2023
Introduction
○ In the first paragraph, the authors write about the global and European prevalence of
stroke. While this is good, I suggest the authors also add about the prevalence of stroke in
India, since this is where the study was conducted.
○ In the second paragraph, the authors address the physical (in)activity of people with stroke
during inpatient rehab. Are there any recommendations for PA during this period for stroke
survivors? i.e. number of steps per day or min spent in different PA levels for example?
○ In the third paragraph, the authors briefly touch on the behavioral mapping tool. I think this
paragraph could be strengthened by expanding on this tool, i.e., what does it consist of?
Also, the authors need to address previous studies that have used this tool in people with
stroke, what have they found? Are there previous studies that have done something like
your study?
Methods
In the 'Eligibility criteria' paragraph:
○ Can the authors give examples of who the caregivers could be?
○ Also, can the authors first list all the inclusion criteria and then list the exclusion criteria?
Was understanding or previous experience of the activity log an inclusion criterion?
In the 'Outcome' paragraph:
○ Did the caregivers or the physios get any training on using the activity log?
○ The authors mention that ""the log chart was sent to 15 experts for validation"". How was this
done? Who were the experts?
Procedure
○ The authors mention that ""The observations were carried out every 15 min"". What happened
when the caregivers or physios had to take a break i.e. go to the toilet or lunch break?
○ Is one day enough to make an overall conclusion? The authors need to strongly justify why
they only did 1 day of measurements.
Results
○ Figure 1, can the authors separate (group) the different activities into the 3 different
domains i.e. physical, cognitive and social? Therefore, it would be easier to see which of
these domains had the best agreement or the worst.
○ It would also be interesting to look at the agreement over the course of the day. For
example, did the accuracy decrease over the day i.e., did the raters get tired of observing
the people with stroke?
Discussion
○ The discussion lacks comparison to other studies that conducted similar observations. What
did they find compared to your results?
Page 19 of 21F1000Research 2022, 11:1227 Last updated: 10 NOV 2023
○ Have the authors thought about using accelerometry to measure activity? Although the
accelerometry might not be able to yield the exact activity being done, it could give an
overall PA output, which could be a good marker for measuring changes in activity levels. I
think this is worth a mention in the discussion.
○ Although I think one can't really draw any conclusion from 1 day of observations, what does
it mean clinically that there is a 60% agreement between the physiotherapist and the
caregivers? Is this enough? What can be done to increase this agreement? Is this a future
valid technique?
○ One of the possible clinical implications of this study is if the caregivers don't want to
participate in the activity logging. Maybe they just want to be present and support the
person affected by stroke.
○ This paper does not have an overall conclusion.

suitable for exon skipping therapy.
Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive study showing the
feasibility of implementing the MLPA method for routine screening of
DMD patients in Indonesia. This is also the first study showing the
potential applicability of exon skipping therapy in the majority of DMD
cases in the country.

Methods
Patients
Forty-threemalepatientsfromDr.SardjitoTeachingHospitalandUniversitasGadjahMada(UGM)AcademicHospital,
Yogyakarta, Indonesia were enrolled in this study, from 2017 to 2018. Clinical manifestations of DMD/BMD were
foundinthepatientsandsupportedbythefindingsofhighserumcreatinekinase(CK)levelsthroughmedicalrecorddata.
Clinical diagnosis was made by qualified and experienced pediatric neurologists who are also trained molecular
geneticists. Up to now, patients have been followed for their clinical management. Genetic analysis was performed
basedonapprovalofparentsthroughsignedwritteninformedconsent.ThestudyprotocolwasapprovedbytheMedical
andHealthResearchEthicsCommitteeoftheFacultyofMedicine,PublicHealthandNursing,UniversitasGadjahMada
(KE/FK/0890/EC/2018)andNationalUniversityofSingaporeInstitutionalReviewBoard(N-19-102E).

Discussion
InDMD/BMD,theincreasedpermeabilityofthesarcolemmaallowsCKfrommusclefiberstobereleasedtoblood
stream,indicatingamuscledamageprocess.ThehighestlevelsofCKarecommonlyobservedbetweentwotofiveyears

DMD/BMDpatientsinourstudy,whichalsoshowedhighCKlevelswithmeanageofonsetatfiveyearsofage.
Theanalysisoffreshfrozenmusclespecimensisusuallyastandardprocedureformusclebiopsy,howeverthisserviceis
not currently available in Indonesia. Instead, FFPE samples from muscle specimens were used to detect dystrophin
expressioninsarcolemmamembrane.SimilaruseofsuchFPPEsampleshavebeenpreviouslyreportedinThailand,Japan
and UK,showing this as a reliable and reproducibletechnique.11Ourimmunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis showed
weak staining of dystrophinproteinin five DMDpatients.Trace-level dystrophin expression inpatientswith out-of-
frameDMDmutationshasbeenpreviouslyreportedinapproximately20%ofDMDpatients.12,13Themechanismforthis
lowlevelofdystrophinhasnotbeenfullyunderstood.Possiblemechanismsincludere-initiationoftranslationdownstream
offrameshiftmutationandalternativesplicingofexonadjacenttodeletionboundariesresultinginrestorationofopen
readingframe.14Indeed,astudybyourgrouppreviouslyshowedthattheformationofsplicingsilencerbyDMDexon
45deletionjunction couldexplain exon44skipping, thereby restoringopenreadingframe.15Threeother cases with
negativedystrophinstainingwereinconsistentwiththeBMDgenotypesandphenotypesobserved.Thenegativeresultof
dystrophin staining could be due to subjectivity in evaluating the IHC result or insufficient pre-analytical treatment.
Moreover, the dystrophin marker used in this study was Dys-2 located in C-terminal, which may not fully capture
expressionintheroddomain.16Duetotheselimitationsandtheinvasivenatureofthemusclebiopsyprocedure,molecular
methodsofgeneanalysisfromblooddrawsofferabetteroptionfordiagnosis.
TheuseoftheMLPAtechniquehasimprovedthedetectionofbothsingleandlargeintragenicrearrangementsbecauseit
allowsthesimultaneousanalysisofall79exonsintheDMDgene,thelargestgeneinthehumangenome.Priortothe
MLPAtechnique,approachessuchasmultiplexPCRusingprimersthatcoversetsofcommonlydeletedexonswould
yielddeletionratesrangingfrom40%to51.2%ofDMD/BMDcasesasreportedinsomeAsianpopulations.17DMDgene
analysis in the Indonesian population has been conducted previously using IHC18 and multiplex PCR19 methods.
However,precisemutationscannotbeidentifiedusingtheIHCmethodwhilemultiplexPCRisunabletocoverallexons
in the DMD gene. Our study using MLPA screening showed that deletions were detected in 69.77% cases while
duplicationswerefoundin11.63%,providingamoleculardiagnosisin81.4%oftotalexaminedcases.Thisresultis
comparable to previous MLPA studies of DMD/BMD cases in Asian populations conducted in China 66–95%,20
India 68%,21 Vietnam (54%),22 Malaysia (77%)23 Japan (70%)2 and Singapore (75%).8 MLPA is suitable to be

detected byMLPAshouldalways beconfirmed withPCR andsequencingas evidencedbyour observations inthis
study.31Twocases(dmd18anddmd31)inthisstudywerein-framemutations,butphenotypicallyDMD.Meanwhile,one
case(dmd28)wasout-frameingenotype,butphenotypicallyBMD.FurtherinvestigationusingmRNAtranscriptsis
neededtorevealthesplicingpatternofthesecasesinordertounderstandhowthediscrepanciesoccurred.Unfortunately,
it was not possible to collect additional samples from the patients for further investigations in the current study.
Concordance to the reading frame rule in our study was 91.43% (32/35), which is similar to other studies in Asia,
includingJapan(93%),1Singapore(96%),8Vietnam(94%),Malaysia(93%)22andChina(88%).20
IncontributingtowardsthespectrumofmutationsintheDMDgene,onenovelmutationwasobservedintwopatients,
dmd19anddmd21,involvingaduplicationofexons2to62(c.(-182_59)(9187_9246)dup).Duplicationfrequencyis

novel mutation in both patients has been deposited into the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD) (ID numbers
00383167and00383168).
PreviousstudiesonthemutationspectrumoftheDMDgeneinJapanshowedthatdeletionswerefoundtoclusterina
proximalhotspot(exon2–20)anddistalhotspot(exon45–55),atafrequencyof26%and65%ofallidentifieddeletions,
respectively.1 This study showed similar results as deletions occurred more frequently in the distal hot spot region
(66.67%),andonly26.67%wereintheproximalhotspotregion.Duplicationmutationsappeartobedistributedacross
theDMDgene;however,theproximalhotspotwasmorefrequentlyduplicatedthanthedistalhotspot,1whichconcurs
withourresultshowingthatallduplications(100%)involvedtheproximalhotspotregion.
In this study, the MLPA method was not able to identify deletion nor duplication in eight patients. Small sequence
mutationsmayoccurinthesecasesleadingtoanegativeresultintheMLPAsincetheclinicalfeatureswereconsistentfor
DMD.FurthersequencinganalysisusingmRNAtodetectbothpointmutationandsplicingpatternsisneededtoreveal
thedisease-causingmutation.MLPAshouldbecombinedwithdirectSangersequencingorwholeexomesequencing
toobtainhighersensitivityandspecificityinthedetectionofsmallorpointmutationsintheDMDgene.33Additionally,
it should be noted that MLPA analysis can generate false positive results by showing an exon deletion when a
polymorphismoccursataprimerligationsite.34Hence,itisalwaysusefultoconductaconfirmatorytestusinganother
method.
Previously,DMDpatientscommonlylosttheirambulationpriorto12yearsofageandcouldonlysurviveuntiltheirlate

the mean age of losing ambulatory ability was still below 12 years old and this may be caused by the difficulty of

duetodifficultyingettingaccesstomoleculartesting.Musclebiopsycanbeperformedtohelpwithdiagnosisusing

University of Padova, Padova, Italy
This is a rigorously conducted and well-written study describing the “genetic architecture” of
dystrophinopathy in 43 patients from two neuromuscular Centers in an Indonesian city. The
literature is quite rich of such papers, showing mutational composition of dystrophinopathy
cohorts from different world populations, and these are indeed, as the authors claim, useful for
directing local health interventions and policies. However, it would be in my opinion also useful to
point out that, in sufficiently large populations, the overall genetic composition of
dystrophinopathies tends to be very similar across world populations, as there are no or very few
“founder” mutations (because of the severe phenotype and X-linked nature) and most, if not all
identified mutations, usually date back to just a few generations.
Moreover, I have some comments and suggestions, as listed below:
1. Table 3: Out-of-frame duplications are not amenable to exon skipping.
2. Also skipping of exon 55 for del 56-74 is very theoretical (no dystroglycan binding in the
expected protein product).
3. c.6808delT is not a nonsense mutation, but rather a frameshift deletion of 1 nucleotide;
therefore a DMD phenotype is expected. The fact that the patient walks at age 9 (with
corticosteroid treatment?) does not exclude a DMD phenotype. This patient should not be
treated with ataluren.
4. How many of the 43 cases are related cases (siblings, cousins, other)? This point is also
relevant for the discussion of de novo frequency in the population (the more siblings, the
less de novo).
5. The 12-nucleotide deletion in exon 65 may disrupt binding to β-dystroglycan, a potential
explanation for a severe phenotype despite ORF preservation in this patient.
6. Figure 5 (pedigrees) is not very useful, as X-linked inheritance is expected and always
Page 22 of 30F1000Research 2023, 11:148 Last updated: 17 NOV 2023
confirmed.
7. “Gowers” instead of “Gower”.
8. Are the Centers where the data were collected wxclusively pediatric? This may exclude from
this population the spectrum of milder BMD which only becomes clinically evident in adult
age, and should be considered in the discussion (i.e. underestimation of in-frame
mutations).
9. For reference 3 I would suggest Monaco et al. (19881), rather than, or in addition to, the
current reference.

Response to reviewer:
1. Table 3: Out-of-frame duplications are not amenable to exon skipping.
Response: Thank you for the comment. We have amended Table 3 to remove this.
2. Also skipping of exon 55 for del 56-74 is very theoretical (no dystroglycan binding in the
expected protein product).
Response: Thank you for the comment. We have amended Table 3 to remove this.
3. c.6808delT is not a nonsense mutation, but rather a frameshift deletion of 1 nucleotide;
therefore a DMD phenotype is expected. The fact that the patient walks at age 9 (with
corticosteroid treatment?) does not exclude a DMD phenotype. This patient should not be treated
with ataluren.
Response: Thank you for pointing out the error. We agree that ataluren will not affect the
patient with the frameshift deletion and have revised Table 3.
4. How many of the 43 cases are related cases (siblings, cousins, other)? This point is also relevant
for the discussion of de novo frequency in the population (the more siblings, the less de novo).
Response: Thank you for the comment. We checked again and none of related cases was
included in this study.
5. The 12-nucleotide deletion in exon 65 may disrupt binding to β-dystroglycan, a potential
explanation for a severe phenotype despite ORF preservation in this patient.
Response: Thank you very much for your insight. We have added this to the 4th paragraph
of the discussion section. All changes are highlighted in yellow in the manuscript text.
6. Figure 5 (pedigrees) is not very useful, as X-linked inheritance is expected and always
confirmed.
Response: Thank you for the suggestion, we have removed Figure 5 from the revised
manuscript.
7. “Gowers” instead of “Gower”.
Response: Thank you for pointing this out. We have made the revision.

8. Are the Centers where the data were collected exclusively pediatric? This may exclude from this
population the spectrum of milder BMD which only becomes clinically evident in adult age and
should be considered in the discussion (i.e. underestimation of in-frame mutations).
Response: Thank you very much for this important point. We agree and have added this
point in the penultimate paragraph of the discussion section.
9. For reference 3 I would suggest Monaco et al. (19881), rather than, or in addition to, the
current reference.

The authors described their findings on the mutations of DMD gene in Indonesian patients with
Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystrophy. This the first report from Indonesia on the use of MLPA for
the molecular diagnosis of DMD, well-written, and with balance clinical, pathological and
molecular data.

There are a few concerns raised:
1. I believe clinical diagnosis was the basis for patients' inclusion into the study. There are 8
patients without evident deletion or duplication. There should be enough information how
these patients were clinically categorized into DMD or BMD or they were simply MD
pending molecular confirmation (eg. (a) if the clinical diagnosis/examination was made by
qualified neurologist/pediatrician (b) information on dmd22 and dmd26 may be very limited
to warrant specific clinical diagnosis of DMD. There was no evident loss of dystrophin in
these patients).
2. Page 4 mentioned that databases were accessed on 6 June 2021. It will be worthwhile to
have an updated comparison as almost a year has lapsed.
3. Table 1 on the column ""Age when wheelchair bound"", it will be clearer to replace ""not yet""
with ""still ambulant"".
4. Table 2 is redundant as the content would have been explained by Table 1.
5. Table 3 and 4 may be combined to focus on discrepancy findings (genotype vs phenotype;
IHC vs phenotype).

1. I believe clinical diagnosis was the basis for patients' inclusion into the study. There
are 8 patients without evident deletion or duplication. There should be enough
information how these patients were clinically categorized into DMD or BMD or they
were simply MD pending molecular confirmation (eg. (a) if the clinical
diagnosis/examination was made by qualified neurologist/pediatrician (b)
information on dmd22 and dmd26 may be very limited to warrant specific clinical
diagnosis of DMD. There was no evident loss of dystrophin in these patients).
Response :
a. The diagnosis was made by qualified pediatric neurologists in our hospital, with enough
years of experiences and also hold degree of PhD in area of genetic and muscular
dystrophy. We have added explanation about this in the method section.
b. DMD/BMD are the most common muscular dystrophy with the patients showing gower
signs, difficulty in walking, increase CK level, AST or ALT at clinical level. This clinical
screening was recommended by previous study as well (1, 2). Male-young patients with
those clinical condition may have high possibility of having DMD gene mutation and enough
reason to do screening with either immunohistochemistry (from tissue biopsy) or MLPA
(form blood).
Unfortunately for patient DMD22 and DMD26, the muscle biopsy was not performed due to
consent problem as it is an invasive procedure. Even though immunohistochemistry result
was not available, and genetic analysis of MLPA did not reveal any mutation, we believe the
clinical data is enough to include the patients. Further tests need to be done to identify
possible small mutations using DNA sequencing. We explained about this in the 7th
paragraph of discussion section (highlighted).
2. Page 4 mentioned that databases were accessed on 6 June 2021. It will be worthwhile to
have an updated comparison as almost a year has lapsed.
Response: This is an important suggestion. However due to technical difficulties, especially
during the pandemic situation, we have been unable to perform a comprehensive database
update. Therefore our most current data is from 6 June 2021.
3. Table 1 on the column ""Age when wheelchair bound"", it will be clearer to replace ""not yet""
with ""still ambulant"".
Response : Thank you very much for this suggestion. The suggestion has been incorporated
in our manuscript.
4. Table 2 is redundant as the content would have been explained by Table 1.
Response : Thank you very much for this suggestion, this table has been removed. Table
numbers have been updated accordingly throughout the manuscript.

Response to reviewer
1. Table 3: Out-of-frame duplications are not amenable to exon skipping.
Response: Thank you for the comment. We have amended Table 3 to remove this.
2. Also skipping of exon 55 for del 56-74 is very theoretical (no dystroglycan binding in the
expected protein product).
Response: Thank you for the comment. We have amended Table 3 to remove this.
3. c.6808delT is not a nonsense mutation, but rather a frameshift deletion of 1 nucleotide;
therefore a DMD phenotype is expected. The fact that the patient walks at age 9 (with
corticosteroid treatment?) does not exclude a DMD phenotype. This patient should not be
treated with ataluren.
Response: Thank you for pointing out the error. We agree that ataluren will not affect the
patient with the frameshift deletion and have revised Table 3.
4. How many of the 43 cases are related cases (siblings, cousins, other)? This point is also
relevant for the discussion of de novo frequency in the population (the more siblings, the
less de novo).
Response: Thank you for the comment. We checked again and none of related cases was
included in this study.
5. The 12-nucleotide deletion in exon 65 may disrupt binding to β-dystroglycan, a potential
explanation for a severe phenotype despite ORF preservation in this patient.
Response: Thank you very much for your insight. We have added this to the 4th paragraph
of the discussion section. All changes are highlighted in yellow in the manuscript text.
6. Figure 5 (pedigrees) is not very useful, as X-linked inheritance is expected and always
confirmed.
Response: Thank you for the suggestion, we have removed Figure 5 from the revised
manuscript.
7. “Gowers” instead of “Gower”.
Response: Thank you for pointing this out. We have made the revision.
Page 29 of 30F1000Research 2023, 11:148 Last updated: 17 NOV 2023
8. Are the Centers where the data were collected exclusively pediatric? This may exclude
from this population the spectrum of milder BMD which only becomes clinically evident in
adult age and should be considered in the discussion (i.e. underestimation of in-frame
mutations).
Response: Thank you very much for this important point. We agree and have added this
point in the penultimate paragraph of the discussion section.
9. For reference 3 I would suggest Monaco et al. (19881), rather than, or in addition to, the
current reference.
Response: Thank you for the suggestion. We have revised reference 3.
10. “However, it would be in my opinion also useful to point out that, in sufficiently large

validate all single exon deletions when using this screening method.
Analysis of available maternal DNA samples showed that the rate of
de novo mutations (48.15%) appears higher than expected in this
population. Out of 31 patients who were classified as DMD based on
clinical and genotype characterizations, 60.47% (n=26) of cases were
suitable for exon skipping therapy.
Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive study showing the
feasibility of implementing the MLPA method for routine screening of
DMD patients in Indonesia. This is also the first study showing the
potential applicability of exon skipping therapy in the majority of DMD
cases in the country.

InDMD/BMD,theincreasedpermeabilityofthesarcolemmaallowsCKfrommusclefiberstobereleasedtoblood

not currently available in Indonesia. Instead, FFPE samples from muscle specimens were used to detect dystrophin

andUK,showingthisas areliableandreproducibletechnique.11Ourimmunohistochemistry (IHC)analysis showed
weak staining of dystrophin protein infiveDMD patients.Trace-level dystrophinexpressionin patientswith out-of-

lowlevelofdystrophinhasnotbeenfullyunderstood.Possiblemechanismsincludere-initiationoftranslationdownstream

negativedystrophinstainingwereinconsistentwiththeBMDgenotypesandphenotypesobserved.Thenegativeresultof
dystrophin staining could be due to subjectivity in evaluating the IHC result or insufficient pre-analytical treatment.
Moreover, the dystrophin marker used in this study was Dys-2 located in C-terminal, which may not fully capture
expressionintheroddomain.16Duetotheselimitationsandtheinvasivenatureofthemusclebiopsyprocedure,molecular
methodsofgeneanalysisfromblooddrawsofferabetteroptionfordiagnosis.
TheuseoftheMLPAtechniquehasimprovedthedetectionofbothsingleandlargeintragenicrearrangementsbecauseit
allowsthesimultaneousanalysisofall79exonsintheDMDgene,thelargestgeneinthehumangenome.Priortothe
MLPAtechnique,approachessuchasmultiplexPCRusingprimersthatcoversetsofcommonlydeletedexonswould
yielddeletionratesrangingfrom40%to51.2%ofDMD/BMDcasesasreportedinsomeAsianpopulations.17DMDgene
analysis in the Indonesian population has been conducted previously using IHC18 and multiplex PCR19 methods.
However,precisemutationscannotbeidentifiedusingtheIHCmethodwhilemultiplexPCRisunabletocoverallexons

it was not possible to collect additional samples from the patients for further investigations in the current study.
Concordance to the reading frame rule in our study was 91.43% (32/35), which is similar to other studies in Asia,
includingJapan(93%),1Singapore(96%),8Vietnam(94%),Malaysia(93%)22andChina(88%).20
IncontributingtowardsthespectrumofmutationsintheDMDgene,onenovelmutationwasobservedintwopatients,

novel mutation in both patients has been deposited into the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD) (ID numbers
00383167and00383168).
PreviousstudiesonthemutationspectrumoftheDMDgeneinJapanshowedthatdeletionswerefoundtoclusterina
proximalhotspot(exon2–20)anddistalhotspot(exon45–55),atafrequencyof26%and65%ofallidentifieddeletions,
respectively.1 This study showed similar results as deletions occurred more frequently in the distal hot spot region
(66.67%),andonly26.67%wereintheproximalhotspotregion.Duplicationmutationsappeartobedistributedacross
theDMDgene;however,theproximalhotspotwasmorefrequentlyduplicatedthanthedistalhotspot,1whichconcurs
withourresultshowingthatallduplications(100%)involvedtheproximalhotspotregion.
In this study, the MLPA method was not able to identify deletion nor duplication in eight patients. Small sequence
mutationsmayoccurinthesecasesleadingtoanegativeresultintheMLPAsincetheclinicalfeatureswereconsistentfor

thedisease-causingmutation.MLPAshouldbecombinedwithdirectSangersequencingorwholeexomesequencing
toobtainhighersensitivityandspecificityinthedetectionofsmallorpointmutationsintheDMDgene.33Additionally,
it should be noted that MLPA analysis can generate false positive results by showing an exon deletion when a
polymorphismoccursataprimerligationsite.34Hence,itisalwaysusefultoconductaconfirmatorytestusinganother

the mean age of losing ambulatory ability was still below 12 years old and this may be caused by the difficulty of

The authors described their findings on the mutations of DMD gene in Indonesian patients with
Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystrophy. This the first report from Indonesia on the use of MLPA for
the molecular diagnosis of DMD, well-written, and with balance clinical, pathological and
molecular data.
There are a few concerns raised:
1. I believe clinical diagnosis was the basis for patients' inclusion into the study. There are 8
patients without evident deletion or duplication. There should be enough information how
these patients were clinically categorized into DMD or BMD or they were simply MD
pending molecular confirmation (eg. (a) if the clinical diagnosis/examination was made by
qualified neurologist/pediatrician (b) information on dmd22 and dmd26 may be very limited
to warrant specific clinical diagnosis of DMD. There was no evident loss of dystrophin in
these patients).
2. Page 4 mentioned that databases were accessed on 6 June 2021. It will be worthwhile to
have an updated comparison as almost a year has lapsed.
3. Table 1 on the column ""Age when wheelchair bound"", it will be clearer to replace ""not yet""
with ""still ambulant"".
4. Table 2 is redundant as the content would have been explained by Table 1.
5. Table 3 and 4 may be combined to focus on discrepancy findings (genotype vs phenotype;
IHC vs phenotype).
Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?
Yes
Page 22 of 26F1000Research 2022, 11:148 Last updated: 17 NOV 2023
Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?
Yes
Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?
No
If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?
Not applicable
Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?
No
Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?
Yes

1. I believe clinical diagnosis was the basis for patients' inclusion into the study. There
are 8 patients without evident deletion or duplication. There should be enough
information how these patients were clinically categorized into DMD or BMD or they
were simply MD pending molecular confirmation (eg. (a) if the clinical
diagnosis/examination was made by qualified neurologist/pediatrician (b)
information on dmd22 and dmd26 may be very limited to warrant specific clinical
diagnosis of DMD. There was no evident loss of dystrophin in these patients).
Response :
a. The diagnosis was made by qualified pediatric neurologists in our hospital, with enough
years of experiences and also hold degree of PhD in area of genetic and muscular
dystrophy. We have added explanation about this in the method section.
b. DMD/BMD are the most common muscular dystrophy with the patients showing gower
signs, difficulty in walking, increase CK level, AST or ALT at clinical level. This clinical
screening was recommended by previous study as well (1, 2). Male-young patients with
those clinical condition may have high possibility of having DMD gene mutation and enough
reason to do screening with either immunohistochemistry (from tissue biopsy) or MLPA
(form blood).
Page 23 of 26F1000Research 2022, 11:148 Last updated: 17 NOV 2023
Unfortunately for patient DMD22 and DMD26, the muscle biopsy was not performed due to
consent problem as it is an invasive procedure. Even though immunohistochemistry result
was not available, and genetic analysis of MLPA did not reveal any mutation, we believe the
clinical data is enough to include the patients. Further tests need to be done to identify
possible small mutations using DNA sequencing. We explained about this in the 7th
paragraph of discussion section (highlighted).
2. Page 4 mentioned that databases were accessed on 6 June 2021. It will be worthwhile to
have an updated comparison as almost a year has lapsed.
Response: This is an important suggestion. However due to technical difficulties, especially
during the pandemic situation, we have been unable to perform a comprehensive database
update. Therefore our most current data is from 6 June 2021.
3. Table 1 on the column ""Age when wheelchair bound"", it will be clearer to replace ""not yet""
with ""still ambulant"".
Response : Thank you very much for this suggestion. The suggestion has been incorporated
in our manuscript.
4. Table 2 is redundant as the content would have been explained by Table 1.
Response : Thank you very much for this suggestion, this table has been removed. Table
numbers have been updated accordingly throughout the manuscript.
Table 3 and 4 may be combined to focus on discrepancy findings (genotype vs phenotype;
IHC vs phenotype).
Response: Thank you very much for this suggestion, table 3 and 4 have been combined.
Table numbers have been updated accordingly throughout the manuscript.
Competing Interests: No competing interests were disclosed.

Response to reviewer
1. Table 3: Out-of-frame duplications are not amenable to exon skipping.
Response: Thank you for the comment. We have amended Table 3 to remove this.
2. Also skipping of exon 55 for del 56-74 is very theoretical (no dystroglycan binding in the
expected protein product).
Response: Thank you for the comment. We have amended Table 3 to remove this.
3. c.6808delT is not a nonsense mutation, but rather a frameshift deletion of 1 nucleotide;
Page 24 of 26F1000Research 2022, 11:148 Last updated: 17 NOV 2023
therefore a DMD phenotype is expected. The fact that the patient walks at age 9 (with
corticosteroid treatment?) does not exclude a DMD phenotype. This patient should not be
treated with ataluren.
Response: Thank you for pointing out the error. We agree that ataluren will not affect the
patient with the frameshift deletion and have revised Table 3.
4. How many of the 43 cases are related cases (siblings, cousins, other)? This point is also
relevant for the discussion of de novo frequency in the population (the more siblings, the
less de novo).
Response: Thank you for the comment. We checked again and none of related cases was
included in this study.
5. The 12-nucleotide deletion in exon 65 may disrupt binding to β-dystroglycan, a potential
explanation for a severe phenotype despite ORF preservation in this patient.
Response: Thank you very much for your insight. We have added this to the 4th paragraph
of the discussion section. All changes are highlighted in yellow in the manuscript text.
6. Figure 5 (pedigrees) is not very useful, as X-linked inheritance is expected and always
confirmed.
Response: Thank you for the suggestion, we have removed Figure 5 from the revised
manuscript.
7. “Gowers” instead of “Gower”.
Response: Thank you for pointing this out. We have made the revision.
8. Are the Centers where the data were collected exclusively pediatric? This may exclude
from this population the spectrum of milder BMD which only becomes clinically evident in
adult age and should be considered in the discussion (i.e. underestimation of in-frame
mutations).
Response: Thank you very much for this important point. We agree and have added this
point in the penultimate paragraph of the discussion section.
9. For reference 3 I would suggest Monaco et al. (19881), rather than, or in addition to, the
current reference.
Response: Thank you for the suggestion. We have revised reference 3.
10. “However, it would be in my opinion also useful to point out that, in sufficiently large
populations, the overall genetic composition of dystrophinopathies tends to be very similar
across world populations, as there are no or very few “founder” mutations (because of the
severe phenotype and X-linked nature) and most, if not all identified mutations, usually date
back to just a few generations”.
Response: We have added this suggested comment in the discussion section as
“Nonetheless, it should be noted that when sufficiently large populations of patients are
analyzed, the overall genetic composition of dystrophinopathies tends to be very similar
across world populations, as there are no or very few “founder” mutations (because of the
severe phenotype and X-linked nature) and most, if not all identified mutations, usually date
back to just a few generations”.

ODS. The most recognized ODS was vaginal bleeding whereas the
least recognized ODS during pregnancy was convulsion; the least
recognized ODS during labor and delivery was retained placenta.
Multivariate regression analysis showed that the predictive factors of
good OBS knowledge included a higher education level, maternal age
of at least 20 years, and having medical personnel as a source of
knowledge.
Page 1 of 14F1000Research 2023, 12:851 Last updated: 27 OCT 2023
Conclusions: In a rural setting of Thailand, two-thirds of pregnant
women had good ODS knowledge. Identifying those at risk for fair
and poor ODS knowledge and prompt management for the
vulnerable subgroups might help decrease maternal mortality.

Therewere415eligiblepregnantwomenattheendoftheenrolment.Ofalltheseparticipants,275(66.27%)hadgood
knowledgeofODS,101(24.34%)hadfairknowledge,and39(9.40%)hadpoorknowledge.ThemostrecognizedODS
wasvaginalbleeding,whichaccountedfor92.29%ofthereportedODSduringpregnancyand80.96%ofthereported

Discussion
Inacommunityhospital-basedantenatalcareservicesinaNortheasternprovinceofThailand,wefoundthatabouttwo-
thirdsofthepregnantwomenhadagoodlevelofknowledgeregardingODS.Wealsofoundthatthefactorsthatwere
associatedwiththegoodODSknowledgeincludedage,educationlevel,andsourceoftheODSknowledgethatthe
pregnantwomenobtainedtheinformation.
The prevalence of good ODS knowledge in our study is higher than those in previous studies. One study in a Thai
universityhospitalinanurbanareareportedaprevalenceof59.8%10andanotherstudyinateachingandreferralhospital
inMalaysiareportedaprevalenceof48.3%.11ThefindingthattheprevalenceofgoodODSknowledgeinThaipregnant
women was slightly higher than that of the Malaysian study might be due to the different score cut-off levels of
goodknowledgeofODS,thatis,80%(16outof20items)intheMalaysianstudywhereas75%(12outof16items)
in our study and the other Thai study. Several studies reported the knowledge of ODS among pregnant women in
manycountries,includingIndia,12,13Nepal,14,15Malaysia,11Ethiopia,16–28Nigeria,29Tanzania,30Egypt,31Jordan,32
Congo,33andUganda.34ThefactthattheprevalenceofmotherswithgoodknowledgeofODSdifferedamongstudies
couldbebecauseofthedifferenceinparticipants’demographiccharacteristicsandthedefinitionofgoodknowledgeof
ODSineachstudy.Overall,theprevalenceofmotherswithgoodknowledgeofODSwasthelowestinAfrica,16–29,35,36
especiallyintheremoteareawheremostparticipantsreceivedlowereducation.
FortheknowledgeofeachODSamongthestudypopulation,wefoundthatvaginalbleedingisthemostmentionedODS
duringpregnancyandduringlabor/deliveryamongparticipants.Lessthan70%oftheparticipantsreportedepigastric
pain, blurred vision, and convulsion during pregnancy as an ODS. A similar proportion mentioned convulsion and
retainedplacentaduringlabor/deliveryasODS.ThesefindingswerecongruentwiththepreviousstudyinThailand.10
Sincevaginalbleedingisavisible,genitalorgan–relatedsign,itiseasilyrecognizedasanODSamongpregnantwomen.
In contrast, since epigastric pain, blurred vision, and convulsion are symptoms of other organ systems, it was more
complicatedtoeducatepregnantwomenthatthesesymptomsmustalsobeperceivedasanODS.
Forthesecondaryobjectiveofthestudy,thepredictivefactorsofgoodknowledgeofODS,wefoundthathighermaternal
educationofatleastaBachelor’sdegree,comparedtohighschoolorlowereducation,isoneofthesignificantpredictors.
This finding is similar to the study from the Thai university hospital.10 Studies in other Asian countries, including
Malaysia11andJordan,32alsofoundthathighermaternaleducationwasasignificantpredictivefactorofgoodknowledge
ofODS.SeveralstudiesfromtheAfricanregion,29,37especiallyEthiopia,20,21,24–26,28,38wherewomenreceivedlower
education,emphasizedthepredictivevalueofwomen’seducationonthelevelofODSknowledge.Thelevelofeducation

demonstrate that these two variables were predictors of better ODS knowledge, many other studies showed the

This study presented data concerning the extent of awareness among pregnant individuals in a
rural area of Thailand regarding indicators of potential pregnancy-associated risks, and whether
they possess acquaintance with this particular information.
The investigators employed both questionnaire surveys and interview methodologies to acquire
the dataset.
The result revealed that approximately 10% of the participants exhibited a deficient knowledge of
Obstetric Danger Signs (ODS), while an additional 25% attained a moderate level of
understanding. Subpopulations characterized by an age below 20 years, limited educational
attainment, and reliance on familial or peer networks as their primary information sources
demonstrated significantly diminished levels of knowledge. Furthermore, this investigation
highlighted the frequent oversight of critical indicators of preeclampsia, such as visual
disturbances, epigastric discomfort, and convulsions, by the participants. This underscores the
scope for healthcare professionals and governmental bodies to implement precise interventions
to improve this situation.
From my perspective, this paper offers enhanced insights into the landscape of pregnancy care
within rural regions of developing countries. Moreover, it highlights a targeted area for potential
development.
There is, however, one aspect requiring further explanation within the Methodology section.
1. what is the rationale behind establishing the threshold for ""good knowledge"" at 75%?
The derivation of this specific percentage warrants further clarification.
Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?

Introduction:
paragraph -2 the statement..""differs among countries, ranging from 23.8 deaths per 100,000 live
births in the US to 442 deaths per 100,000 births in Africa"". The authors chose to give a MMR
lowest starting with USA - why not start with the country (ies) with the lowest MMR (<5/100,000)
e.g. from a publication ""Trends in maternal mortality 2000 to 2020: estimates by WHO, UNICEF,
UNFPA, World Bank Group and UNDESA/Population Division"".
Paragraph 4 - there are several statements in this paragraph that need to be supported with
references (sentences 2,3,4,5).

were associated with positive knowledge. Being a non-health worker
and lacking access to electronic media sources were associated with
worse attitudes.
Conclusion: Overall, we identified poor knowledge and suboptimal
attitudes toward stroke. These findings reflect the need for effective
public health approaches to improve stroke awareness, knowledge,
and attitudes for effective prevention in the community. Presently,
this is of utmost necessity, given the increased occurrence of stroke
and its severity among COVID-19 patients.

Stroke is a multifactorial condition; the most significant risk drivers include hypertension, high body mass index,
dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoking, and a family history of stroke.11,12 Analysis of reports pertaining to the COVID

study has demonstrated that COVID-19 associated ischaemic strokes tend to be more severe and can lead to death
compared to non-infected stroke patients14 and COVID vaccination was associated with both ischemic stroke and
vaccine-inducedimmunethromboticthrombocytopenia15;andcerebralvenousthrombosis.16

Discussion
Thepresentstudywasconductedtoassesstheknowledgeandattitudestowardsstrokeinageneralpopulationsamplein
theUAEduringtheCOVID-19pandemic.Generally,weidentifiedsuboptimalknowledgeandattitudestowardstroke.
Attitudestowardstrokepreventionseemedsuboptimalforpreventivemeasures;manyknewabouthypertension,andless
than two-thirds knew about blood glucose control. The sources of information were also varied and underutilized,
especiallyhealthcareproviders.
Generally,andtothebestofourknowledge,studiesfromtheMiddleEasthavereportedsuboptimallevelsofknowledge
ofstroke.MostofthestudiesfromtheMiddleEasthavereportedinadequateknowledgeregardingstrokeriskfactorsand
warning symptoms25–30; on the other hand, only a few studies have reported an adequate level of awareness.31,32
Similarly,studiesfromdifferentpartsoftheworldhavereportedaninadequateunderstandingofstrokeinthegeneral
population.33,34
Morethanhalfofourstudyparticipantswereaged18to25.Therehavebeenfewpreviousstudiesonstrokeawareness
among adolescents and young adults. Studies from Nepal have reported knowledge of stroke in the younger demo-
graphics.35,36Participantsreportedknowingsomeonewithastrokewhichcouldhavecontributedtobetterunderstand-
ing.36 However, many participants did not recognize stroke as a brain disease.36 Similarly, some studies in western
countrieshaveshowninconsistentawarenessofthisaspect.37,38IntheNepalesestudies,manyidentifiedhypertension,
alcohol,andsmokingasriskfactors.However,fewcouldidentifyallriskfactorstogether.Manybelievedthatstroke
could present with sudden weakness or numbness of limbs, and less than half were able to identify three or more
symptomsofastroke.Morethantwo-thirdsofparticipantsbelievedstrokecouldbetreated,andmorethanfour-fifth
believed stroke could be prevented.36 Many said they would take patients to the hospital and that they would need
immediatemedicaltreatment.
Pradhanetal.reportedbetterknowledgeamongmaleparticipants35;however,Thapaetal.reportedthatgenderwasnot
associatedwithknowledgeofriskfactorsorwarningsigns.36Thiswasincontrasttoourstudy,asgenderwasnota

In comparison, a recent study from the USA among adolescents reported that stroke knowledge was relatively
inadequate.45 Approximately half knew that stroke occurs in the brain, two-thirds said they would call emergency
services,andabouthalfwereawareoftheacronymFAST(face,arms,speech,time).Theknowledgeofstrokesymptoms
and risk factors was generally low, with no difference in scores according to gender in similarity to our findings.
Furthermore,asurrogatemarkerofsocioeconomicstatus,theparentaleducationlevel,wasusedtoassessthecontribution
tostrokeknowledge;norelationshipbetweensurveyscoresandthefather’slevelofeducationwasseen,buttherewasa
significantassociationbetweensurveyscoresandthemother’slevelofeducation.
A community-based study from India, where stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, reported that
participantsknewthebasicconnotationsofstrokeandparalysis.However,knowledgeaboutredflagsandstrokerisk
factorswasinadequate.34Signsandsymptomsidentifiedwereparalysisandlossofconsciousness,buttherewasalackof
awarenessofheadache,vomiting,andfits.Participantswerewellaware ofhypertensionasariskfactorbutlessfor
diabetesandsmoking.Hypertensionwasoneofthemostfrequentlyrecognizedriskfactors,asinanotherstudyfrom
Iran.45 In comparison, a survey in South Korea reported better awareness about stroke; hypertension was the most
commonriskfactoridentified,andparesiswasthemostcommonlyreportedsymptom.Aroundtwo-thirdswereableto
identifyoneormoresymptoms46;incontrast,inourstudy,halfoftheparticipantsidentifiedfivesymptoms(resultsnot
tabulated).
Inourstudy,knowledgeandattitudestowardstrokedidnotdifferbyagecategory.Nevertheless,previousstudieshave
consistently shown that different age groups were differently associated with knowledge and attitudes towards
stroke.28,45,47,48 In our study, being a student was associated with positive knowledge scores and a non-healthcare
workerwithpoorerattitudes.Similartoourfindings,astudyfromSaudididnotreportthatattitudesdifferedbygender.49
Moreover,somestudieshavereportedthatknowledgedifferedwithacademiclevel,andhighereducationwasapredictor
of better knowledge.45,50–52 Similarly, a recent European review reported that a higher socioeconomic position was
associatedwithbetterknowledgeofstrokeriskfactorsandwarningsigns.53AreviewfromtheUKreportedagood
awarenessofredflagsofunilateralweaknessandspeechdisturbance;however,thefirstpointofcontactmentionedwasa
general practitioner rather than emergency services.54 In our study, a little over two-thirds said they would call an
ambulance,andthisfindingisnotverydifferentfromtheMiddleEast.30
Itisreassuringtoseethatdespitestudiesreportinginadequateunderstandingofstroke,therewasapositiveattitude
towardcallinganemergencyincaseapersondisplayedsignsorsymptomsofstroke,55,56whileothersarereportingtaking
thepatienttothehospital.57Inourstudy,beinganon-healthcareworkerwasassociatedwithpoorerattitudes.Hence
effortsshouldbemadetoreachouttodifferentsectorsandaddressgapsinknowledgeandattitudestowardsstroke.
Moreover,electronicmediacampaignscouldplayanimportantroleinraisingpublicawarenessandimprovingattitudes
byemployingavarietyofsocialmediaplatformsandtypesofmessages.
Someofthestrengthsofthisstudyareasfollows:First,thestudyisoneofthefewstudiesthatcomprehensivelyquantify
knowledgeandpracticesandwouldhelpidentifycommonknowledgegapsintheUAEpopulation.Second,thestudy
wasconductedonarepresentativesampleofthegeneralpopulationcomprisingofdiversebackgroundsandprovideda
projectionoftheknowledgeandattitudesinthecommunity.Third,weusedavalidatedandreliablequestionnaireto
collectresponses.Lastly,wehadalargesamplesizeandareasonableresponserate,allowingustoconductanalyseswith
goodstatisticalpowertodetectassociations.
There are some limitations, however: The self-reported nature of specific measures such as income may lead to
misclassificationbiasoftheindependentvariablesinthestudy.Moreover,self-reportingofinformationmaybebiased
byoverestimatingorunderestimatingactualattitudesrelatedtostroke.Next,aswithstudiesofobservationalnature,itcan
bechallengingtodrawdefiniteconclusionsaboutcausalityandtemporalrelationships;henceweneedfurtherresearch
with more robust study designs and pre-post interventional studies to assess the impact on knowledge and attitudes
towardsstrokeinthecommunity.Also,someoftherespondentsdidnotanswerthequestionsiftheywereeitherworking
orstudyinginthehealthcarefieldornot.Finally,theagedistributionofparticipantsinourstudydoesnotreflecttheage
distributedinthegeneralpopulationintheUAE.Biasindatacollectionmayproducethisproblem.Nonetheless,we
believethattheimpactofthisbiasonthevalidityofthefindingsmaynotbesignificant.
Conclusions
The present study showed a general inadequacy of knowledge regarding stroke and suboptimal attitudes towards
someonepresentingwithstrokesignsandsymptoms.Thecommunityshouldbefamiliarizedwiththe“FAST”acronym
to recognize a stroke and access appropriate services as soon as possible. There is an urgent need for widespread
educational interventions regarding stroke risk factors, especially among non-medical professions, and involving

I appreciate the authors for undertaking this important piece of research. It is a well-conducted
study with scientific merits. This study can be a baseline research for many potential future
researchers and hence must be published.
Title: The title should be made simple and clearer. Currently, it is too long and confusing.
Keywords: Need to be alphabetically arranged
Stroke is generally considered to occur in elderly people. However, in this research, the
participants are mainly young people/students. Authors need to mention this as a major
limitation. This limits the study to generalize the findings to the general public. It would have been
nice to focus only on the students rather than the general public in this case.
The Introduction section has to mention more about the probable mechanism of stroke in COVID-
19 patients. Authors need to focus more on the topic with more literature added.
It is not clear why authors have chosen ‘hypertension’ to assume the prevalence of stroke. This
needs more explanation.
The questionnaire design is not clearly mentioned in the methodology section. The construct,
content, and face validity need to be mentioned in detail. The final questionnaire must be added
as an appendix. The authors also need to mention why they developed a new questionnaire rather
than adopting an existing one. What is the uniqueness of the newly developed tool? The actual
Cronbach alpha value has to be mentioned. The data collection process has to be elaborated.
What was the mode of circulation of the questionnaire? How were the subjects chosen?
The discussion rarely mentions about the relationship between COVID-19 and stroke knowledge.
Page 14 of 28F1000Research 2023, 12:322 Last updated: 13 OCT 2023
Hence some rewriting is needed.
The Conclusion is misleading. How can the authors say the knowledge on stroke is ‘inadequate’
and ‘suboptimal’ attitudes? Authors need to first establish the criteria for how they arrived at such
conclusions. This has to be clearly mentioned in the methodology.
Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?
Yes
Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?
Yes
Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?
Yes
If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?
Yes
Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?
Yes
Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?
Partly
Competing Interests: No competing interests were disclosed.

Dear Reviewer,
Thank you for taking the time to review our work titled “Are we aware of stroke risk factors
and warning signs amid COVID-19? Knowledge and attitude towards risk-factors, signs and
symptoms of stroke among the UAE population during COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-
sectional study” and providing us with your insightful feedback to improve the manuscript.
We have included answers in the manuscript to the questions put forth. Please see below
the point-by-point responses to the questions.
Q1. Title: The title should be made simple and clearer. Currently, it is too long and
Page 15 of 28F1000Research 2023, 12:322 Last updated: 13 OCT 2023
confusing.
Are we aware of stroke risk factors and warning signs amid COVID-19? Knowledge and
attitude towards risk-factors, signs and symptoms of stroke among the UAE population
during COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study
Answer: Thank you for your comment. The above title was shortened to
“Assessment of Knowledge and attitude towards Stroke among the UAE population during
COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study”
Q 2. Keywords: Need to be alphabetically arranged
Answer: Please see the re-arranged keywords that were inserted in the manuscript
Attitude, Awareness, Cross-sectional, Knowledge, Stroke, Survey
Q 3. Stroke is generally considered to occur in elderly people. However, in this
research, the participants are mainly young people/students. Authors need to
mention this as a major limitation. This limits the study to generalize the findings to
the general public. It would have been nice to focus only on the students rather than
the general public in this case.
Answer: The authors agree with the comment. The following is mentioned in the limitation
section of the manuscript:
“ the age distribution of participants in our study was mostly young people/students and
hence does not reflect the age distributed in the general population in the UAE. Bias in data
collection may produce this problem. Nonetheless, we believe that the impact of this bias
on the validity of the findings may not be significant”
Q 4. The Introduction section has to mention more about the probable mechanism of
stroke in COVID-19 patients. Authors need to focus more on the topic with more
literature added.
Answer: Thank you for the suggestion. The following was added to the introduction section.
ACE receptors, where the COVID virus binds to gain intracellular entry, is expressed in many
cells, including epithelial and endothelial cells, which trigger an immediate immunological
activation that can lead to hypercoagulability and thrombosis. Multisystem thrombosis,
including ischemic stroke, has been associated with severe COVID-19 infection. The
pathogenesis is further compounded, given that the fibrinolytic pathway ceases operation.
While the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related neurovascular events is not yet clear, some
major pathogenic mechanisms have been put forth. These include innate system
hyperinflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and disruption of the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system, hence impacting blood flow, oxidative stress and excessive platelet
aggregation (Wijeratne et al. 2021).

Q 5. It is not clear why authors have chosen ‘hypertension’ to assume the prevalence
of stroke. This needs more explanation.
Answer: Thank you for this valuable comment.
Hypertension is the single most important modifiable stroke risk factor therefore, its value
from the literature was used in the calculation of the sample size. This approach has also
been used in previous literature:

6. doi:10.1186/s12883-022-02853-5)
Q 6. The questionnaire design is not clearly mentioned in the methodology section.
The construct, content, and face validity need to be mentioned in detail. The final
questionnaire must be added as an appendix. The authors also need to mention why
they developed a new questionnaire rather than adopting an existing one. What is the
uniqueness of the newly developed tool? The actual Cronbach alpha value has to be
mentioned. The data collection process has to be elaborated. What was the mode of
circulation of the questionnaire? How were the subjects chosen?
A) The construct, content, and face validity need to be mentioned in detail
Answer: Thank you for this comment. The bolded text is the additional info added to the
manuscript to clarify this point as requested.
The survey started with a brief introduction that described the study objectives,
emphasized the confidentiality of the participants, and informed them that
completing the survey represents consent to participate in the study. The survey
included socio-demographic questions, twenty-five questions evaluating the
knowledge of stroke comprising the organ affected, stroke attributes (preventable or
recurrent), effect on daily activities, treatment, prevention, risk factors, and signs and
symptoms. Six questions evaluating attitude (the approach) towards preventative
measures and actions to take if someone showed signs and symptoms of a stroke. All
knowledge and attitude questions had a yes/no answer. Lastly, there was a question
about the sources of information. For the 25-item knowledge questions, the score
range was 0-25. For attitudes, the score range was 0-6. Each correct statement for
knowledge and optimal attitude got a 1; otherwise, 0.
A questionnaire draft was written and sent to a panel of experts in the pharmacy profession
at Al-Ain University for face and content validity. They examined many factors of the
questionnaire, including the length, conciseness, language, clarity, time, appropriateness,
and bias of questions. Content validation of a questionnaire was aligned with
recommendations.
The content validity was as follows:
B) The final questionnaire must be added as an appendix.

C) The authors also need to mention why they developed a new questionnaire rather
than adopting an existing one. What is the uniqueness of the newly developed tool?
Answer: Thank you for this valuable comment. The yellow highlights is the additional info.
that was added to the methods section (Design of questionnaire):
The questionnaire was developed after a careful literature review of previous studies
utilizing standardized and validated instruments (25–28). Some questions were included to
suit the public within the UAE e.g. city of residence, place of birth.
The uniqueness of this questionnaire is that it is designed to suit the UAE public. To the best
of our knowledge and up to the time this study was conducted, there was not any single
study that was conducted across the UAE.
D) The actual Cronbach alpha value has to be mentioned.
Answer: Thank you. The following was added
The Cronbach alpha value determined was 0.72. According to Nunnally's criteria, an α ≥
0.70 should be regarded as an acceptable reliability
E) The data collection process has to be elaborated.
Answer: Thank you for this comment. The following was included:
Data was collected from study participants using Google Forms between September 2021 to
January 2022. Participants were briefed about the study’s purpose and informed about the
study’s confidentiality and anonymity policy. Each participant was invited to answer the
survey after consent. The questionnaire was self-administered.
F) What was the mode of circulation of the questionnaire?
Answer: The following was added to the method sections
The online, self-administered survey was randomly distributed via a convenience sampling
technique
G) How were the subjects chosen?
Answer: Thank you for your comment. Please refer to the Inclusion and exclusion criteria:
They were the following:
UAE residents (> 2 years living in the UAE) regardless of their nationality, over the age of 18
years and consented (on the questionnaire by ticking the agreement option) to participate
were included in this study. Participants who lived < 2-years in the UAE or did not consent to
participate were excluded.
Q 7. The discussion rarely mentions about the relationship between COVID-19 and
stroke knowledge. Hence some rewriting is needed.
Answer: Thank you for the feedback. The following will be inserted after 7th paragraph of
the discussion (highlighted yellow in the manuscript).
We observed that inadequate knowledge was significantly associated with not having heard
of stroke, not knowing someone with a stroke, and not receiving stroke-related information
Page 18 of 28F1000Research 2023, 12:322 Last updated: 13 OCT 2023
from either a healthcare provider or electronic media. Note that the study was conducted
during the COVID-19 when there was a nationwide extended lockdown. Hence, the lack of
stroke knowledge and awareness could be due to the public limited access to healthcare
providers or due to the limited healthcare provider-led educational campaigns during the
quarantine period. Also, the lack of use of electronic media by the participants could have
contributed to the public’s gap in knowledge. Hence, overall, the lack of accessibility to
healthcare providers and perhaps also to electronic media could have resulted in poor
stroke awareness and knowledge. Stroke inadequate knowledge is of great concern given
that ischemic stroke is a well-documented side effect of COVID-19. In a US study, it was
observed that 46.35% of imaging confirmed ischemic stroke patients had COVID-19 (Belani
et al. 2020). Also, the incidence of stroke in COVID-19 patients ranged between 0.9% to
3.3% in several large retrospective studies. Also, higher mortality was reported in patients
with COVID-19 who have ischemic stroke compared to control ischemic stroke patients.
Furthermore, ischemic stroke was shown to develop in COVID-19 patients with or without
co-morbidities (Elfasi et al. 2021). Hence, stroke knowledge-based educational campaigns
provided and led by health care personnel are of utmost importance during the pandemic.

Q 8. The Conclusion is misleading. How can the authors say the knowledge on stroke is
‘inadequate’ and ‘suboptimal’ attitudes? Authors need to first establish the criteria for
how they arrived at such conclusions. This has to be clearly mentioned in the
methodology.
Answer: The following was placed in the methodology section-Design of the of
questionnaire:
Based on the modified Bloom’s cut-off point, a participant who scored ≥80% of the correct
knowledge questions (≥20 points out of 25) was considered as having “good/adequate
knowledge”; moderate if the score was between 60 and 79%, (≥15-19 out of 25), and
poor/inadequate if the score was less than 60% (<15 points out of 25). For attitude, a
respondent who scored ≥80% of the correct attitude questions (≥4.8 points out of 6) was
considered as having a “good attitude” or moderate/suboptimal attitude if the score was
between 60 and 79%, (≥3.6-4.7 out of 6), and poor attitude if the score was less than 60%
(<3.6 points out of 6) (Feleke et al. 2021).

The authors present the results of a cross-sectional study aimed to assess the general public
knowledge and attitudes on stroke and stroke risk factors in the United Arab Emirates during the
COVID-19 pandemic. 500 participants ≥ 18 years and from the general public in The United Arab
Emirates completed a self-administered questionnaire constructed in Arabic and English on
sociodemographic characteristics and stroke knowledge and attitudes. The authors identified poor
knowledge and suboptimal attitudes toward stroke. For a better presentation of the data, it is
necessary to clarify the following issues:
1. It would be interesting to know if there were differences between the young (18-25 years
old) and non-young healthy recruits with respect to knowledge and attitudes toward stroke.
2. In the Discussion, it should be noted that in a study on the knowledge of stroke in Catalonia
(Spain) it was observed a scant knowledge of cerebrovascular disease in a sample of
teenagers. Therefore, this knowledge should be integrated into the school curriculum (see
and add this reference Rev Neurol 2003; 37: 500).
3. A brief concluding comment on other possible lines of future research on the presented
topic would be appreciated

Dear Reviewer,
Thank you for taking the time to review our work titled “Are we aware of stroke risk factors
and warning signs amid COVID-19? Knowledge and attitude towards risk-factors, signs and
symptoms of stroke among the UAE population during COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-
sectional study” and providing us with your insightful feedback to improve the manuscript.
We have included answers in the manuscript to the questions put forth. Please see below
the point-by-point responses to the questions.
1. It would be interesting to know if there were differences between the young (18-25
years old) and non-young healthy recruits with respect to knowledge and attitudes
toward stroke.
Author Response: Thank you for your comment. Indeed, our findings suggest that
knowledge among young participants (18-25 years old) was not statistically different in
comparison to the ³ 65 years old group (estimate coefficient= 0.87; P=0.84, Table 4).
Similarly, there was not a statistical difference in attitude scores when comparing the two
groups (estimate coefficient= -0.42; P=0.84, Table 5).
2. In the Discussion, it should be noted that in a study on the knowledge of stroke in
Catalonia (Spain) it was observed a scant knowledge of cerebrovascular disease in a
sample of teenagers. Therefore, this knowledge should be integrated into the school
curriculum (see and add this reference Rev Neurol 2003; 37: 500).
Author Response: Thank you for your comment.
The following was added to the discussion section.
Additionally, limited knowledge of cerebrovascular disease was observed among teenagers
in Spain, hence the need for integrating topics related to neurovascular disease within the
school curriculum (Arboix and Arboix-Alió, 2003).

Author Response: Thank you for the suggestion:
The following was inserted at the end of the discussion section:
The future direction of the study can focus on conducting a cross-sectional study to assess
the stroke knowledge and attitude among COVID-19-infected individuals and COVID-19
vaccine recipients, a significant risk group highly susceptible to stroke occurrence. Also, it is
interesting to asses if stroke incidence dropped post-COVID-19 period.

The current cross-sectional study highlights the level of knowledge and attitude of stroke and
among a sample of the UAE population. Also, the association of variables including
sociodemographics with knowledge and attitude scores was carried out using linear regression
analysis. The rationale of the study is sound given the link between COVID 19 infection and
vaccination with stroke. Results are clear and organized with acceptable statistical analysis. The
conclusions drawn from the findings are appropriate and not overinterpreted. The study is of
significance given the findings and the recommendations for educational awareness among the
general population and high-risk individuals in the community. However, there is an issue with the
population representation.
The following recommendations to improve the paper are listed below:

Response. Thank you for the comment. The following was added to the intro section:
Multisystem thrombosis, including ischemic stroke, has been associated with severe COVID-
19 infection. The pathogenesis is further compounded, given that the fibrinolytic pathway
ceases operation. Also, ACE receptors, where the COVID-19 virus binds to gain intracellular
entry, are expressed in many cells, including endothelial cells of the blood vessels. This
could disrupt the renin–angiotensin system, which modulates blood flow, further
contributing to the pathogenesis process (Wijeratne et al. 2021).

https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.607221
5) Elaborate on why the COVID vaccine can cause stroke.
Response: The vaccine's most adverse side effect is vaccine-induced immune
thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT), also known as thrombosis with
thrombocytopenia syndrome. This immune-mediated condition is caused by the
development of pathological anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies following vaccination

against COVID-19, which leads to intense activation of platelets and the coagulation system.
The subsequent clinical syndrome includes life-threatening thrombosis and secondary
haemorrhage (Kolahchi et al. 2022).

6) Methods:
○ State the domains clearly
○ Response: Thank you for this comment. Below is the additional information added to
the manuscript to clarify the domains.
○ The survey started with a brief introduction that described the study objectives,
emphasized the confidentiality of the participants, and informed them that
completing the survey represents consent to participate in the study. The survey
included the following domains: socio-demographic questions, twenty-five questions
evaluating the knowledge of stroke comprising the organ affected, stroke attributes
(preventable or recurrent), effect on daily activities, treatment, prevention, risk
factors, and signs and symptoms. Six questions evaluating attitude (the approach)
towards preventative measures and actions to take if someone showed signs and
symptoms of a stroke. All knowledge and attitude questions had a yes/no answer.
Lastly, there was a question about the sources of information. For the 25-item
knowledge questions, the score range was 0-25. For attitudes, the score range was 0-

19 out of 25), and poor/inadequate if the score was less than 60% (<15 points out of
25). For attitude, a respondent who scored ≥80% of the correct attitude questions
(≥4.8 points out of 6) was considered as having a “good attitude”,
moderate/suboptimal attitude if the score was between 60 and 79%, (≥3.6-4.7 out of
6), and poor attitude if the score was less than 60% (<3.6 points out of 6) (Feleke et al.
2021).
○ What part of the population was the study performed on?
○ Response: The study included both locals (Emiratis) and expats (residents)
○ What was/were the main attitude question(s)? Provide examples to focus the reader’s
attention.
○ Response: Six questions evaluating attitude (the approach) towards preventative
measures and actions to take if someone shows signs and symptoms of a stroke.

7) Results:
(Table 5). There was no mention between the association of lack of information from health
care provide with attitude in the results description
Response: Thank you for the comment. The following (in yellow highlight) has been added:
“Regarding attitudes, being a non-healthcare worker (estimate = -0.73; P < 0.01) and lack of
information from health care provider (estimate = -0.31; P=0.03) and on electronic media
(estimate = -0.30; P = 0.02) were associated with poorer attitudes
8) Discussion:
○ Page 10, last paragraph: “This was in contrast to our study, as gender etc..” doesn’t fit
the context. Revise the statement
○ Response: Thank you. Replaced the above with “Similar to Thapa et al. study (36), in
our study, gender...............
○ Knowledge was suboptimal; state plausible reasons for that. Is there a disconnect
between resources and the population? Is there a scarcity of provided information?
○ Response: Thank you for the feedback. The following have been added to the
discussion section: We observed that poor knowledge was significantly associated
with not having heard of stroke, not knowing someone with a stroke, and not
receiving stroke-related information from either a healthcare provider or electronic
media. Note that the study was conducted during COVID-19 when there was a
nationwide extended lockdown. Hence, the lack of stroke knowledge and awareness
could be due to the public limited access to healthcare providers or limited healthcare
provider-led educational campaigns during quarantine. Also, the lack of use of
electronic media by the participants could have contributed to the public’s gap in
knowledge. Hence, the lack of accessibility to healthcare providers and perhaps also
to electronic media could have resulted in poor stroke awareness and knowledge.
○ ~ 30% of the UAE are bachelor's graduates. However, post-analysis, nearly half of the
subjects were young and undergraduate students. Provide the implication regarding
this discrepancy?
○ Response: The authors agree with the comment. The following is mentioned in the
limitation section of the manuscript: “ the age distribution of participants in our study
was mostly young people/students and hence does not reflect the age distributed in
the general population in the UAE. Bias in data collection may produce this problem.
Nonetheless, we believe that the impact of this bias on the validity of the findings
may not be significant”
○ What about rural-based participants? Were they included in the study? This needs to
be included in the limitation section
○ Response: The following has been added to the limitation section: “While the study
was conducted in several UAE major urban cities, rural cities participants were not
represented.”

First of all, reading the manuscript gives vital information of the quality of healthcare that
warrants a quality overhaul. I am saddened by the findings although it is critical to make everyone
know through research dissemination so readers can ruminate on culturally-relevant training and
support for nurses, joint policy-making between implementers and surveillance agencies, and
exercise of governance for reviewing the standards for patient safety.
Second, the descriptive statistics have underscored the reality that met the aims of the study.
However, the data distribution could have been indicated and explored for skewness in order to
expose the gaps in knowledge distribution. This knowledge distribution may reveal implicit
'disparity' (the access of resources and culturally inflated communicative actions). There is
discourse of representation by the data points.
Third, the Chi-square tests and Fisher exact test did work, but if the authors can consider finding
causal relationships then it would be a lot meaningful at the level of designing an intervention that
targets specific factors/variables.
Fourth, establishing that Yemeni nurses have inadequate knowledge should not only be
exploratory rather explanatory. Plans for training improvement must be articulated explicitly. It is
clear that the authors just wanted to tell the world about a pervasive problem in Yemen, but the
problem is at the healthcare system level. So, it may not only be a case of enteral nutrition.
Fifth, I have these suggestions:
○ The title will be better if revised to: ""Associated ICU nurses' characteristics to clinical enteral
nutrition knowledge in Sana'a, Yemen public hospitals: A basis for remodeling safety and
quality of care standards"".
○ The discussion must connect the level of knowledge with (threat to) patient safety and
quality improvements required. SWOT analysis is highly suggested.
Page 10 of 22F1000Research 2022, 9:759 Last updated: 05 JUL 2023
○ On the other hand, please consider using system dynamics modeling at Vensim PLE. Here is
a tutorial. This can be useful to show the impact of training to improvements in care. This
serves as an attractive and alternative modeling.
○ p-value of less than .05 must be statistically significant.
○ This paper should be solution-oriented.

RESPONSE TO COMMENTS
Thank you for your email, and we appreciate all your suggestions for improving the
manuscript's quality.
The responses to the comments are as follows.
COMMENT # 1: First of all, reading the manuscript gives vital information of the quality of
healthcare that warrants a quality overhaul. I am saddened by the findings although it is
critical to make everyone know through research dissemination so readers can ruminate on
Page 11 of 22F1000Research 2022, 9:759 Last updated: 05 JUL 2023
culturally-relevant training and support for nurses, joint policy-making between
implementers and surveillance agencies, and exercise of governance for reviewing the
standards for patient safety.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comments. Indeed, our findings were based on the
predetermined study objectives. Based on the current findings, we stated that ""this would
enable decision-makers to develop a need-based plan to fill the existing gap, and Yemeni
nurses' knowledge would allow to grow professionally and provide safe health-care
services. However, we will consider your valuable comment in our future work.
COMMENT # 2: Second, the descriptive statistics have underscored the reality that met the
aims of the study. However, the data distribution could have been indicated and explored
for skewness in order to expose the gaps in knowledge distribution. This knowledge
distribution may reveal implicit 'disparity' (the access of resources and culturally inflated
communicative actions). There is discourse of representation by the data points.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. We conducted skewness in order to expose the
gaps in knowledge distribution. As shown in table and figure, the distribution of knowledge
was symmetric.
COMMENT # 3: Third, the Chi-square tests and Fisher exact test did work, but if the authors
can consider finding causal relationships then it would be a lot meaningful at the level of
designing an intervention that targets specific factors/variables.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. We did, in fact, perform the Chi-square and Fisher
exact tests. Unfortunately, because it was not one of our study aims, we did not explore the
causal relationships. However, we have included this useful suggestion in our study
recommendations for further research. Please see lines 4-6 in the last paragraph of the
discussion section.
COMMENT # 4: Fourth, establishing that Yemeni nurses have inadequate knowledge should
not only be exploratory rather explanatory. Plans for training improvement must be
articulated explicitly. It is clear that the authors just wanted to tell the world about a
pervasive problem in Yemen, but the problem is at the healthcare system level. So, it may
not only be a case of enteral nutrition.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your insightful observation and comment. In fact, our study
objective was to explore the level of ICU Nurses' knowledge regarding enteral nutrition.
Based on our study findings, we have discussed and explained the findings, in discussion
section. Please see the discussion part. Based on your advice, we have already added a
recommendation for additional research to examine the causal relationships.
COMMENT # 5: Fifth, I have these suggestions:
COMMENT: The title will be better if revised to: ""Associated ICU nurses' characteristics to
clinical enteral nutrition knowledge in Sana'a, Yemen public hospitals: A basis for
remodeling safety and quality of care standards"". RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment.
Page 12 of 22F1000Research 2022, 9:759 Last updated: 05 JUL 2023
We have updated the study title based on your suggestion. COMMENT: The discussion must
connect the level of knowledge with (threat to) patient safety and quality improvements
required. SWOT analysis is highly suggested.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. We employed the elements of discussion in this
present study. We humbly believe that SWOT analysis in the discussion part can be used in
our future interrogations. COMMENT: On the other hand, please consider using system
dynamics modeling at Vensim PLE. Here is a tutorial. This can be useful to show the impact
of training to improvements in care. This serves as an attractive and alternative modeling.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment and useful tutorial link. Indeed, our study was not
aimed to show the impact of training to improvements in care. Nevertheless, we will take
this into consideration in our future research endeavor and will put this in one of our
conclusion and recommendations. Please see lines 5&6 of the conclusion section.
COMMENT: p-value of less than .05 must be statistically significant.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. We would like to clarify that our hypothesis was
that the cut point value for significant, “A p-value of ≤0.05 reported as statistically
significant” COMMENT: This paper should be solution-oriented. RESPONSE: Thank you for
your comment. Based on the study findings, we proposed a solution to improve the nurses'
knowledge regarding enteral nutrition. Please see the conclusion section.
Competing Interests: We don't have any competing interests.

The manuscript ""Intensive care nurses' knowledge of enteral nutrition at public hospitals in
Sana'a, Yemen: a cross-sectional survey"" by Talal Ali Hussein Al-Qalah, et al. is a descriptive cross-
sectional study from four public hospitals in the capital city of Yemen. The authors intended to
assess the level of ICU nurses’ knowledge regarding the management of enteral nutrition. The
authors recruit 174 nurses in 2019. The authors found that 46% of them had an inadequate level
of knowledge regarding enteral nutrition management. From my impressions, the aim of this
study may not be interested in countries other than Yemen.

authors did this study.

2. Methods: Sample size determination: I’m not familiar with the equation the authors used.
Can the authors provide the reference to support this sample size calculation?
3. Methods: Did the authors use the questionnaire which was previously developed or which
was newly created? If the authors use the questionnaire which was newly created, how and
why the authors could define that a score of 50% or less was considered inadequate,
51–75% moderate, while 76% and above was considered adequate. The cut-off score should
be carefully selected.
4. Methods: Please clearly describe how to perform the multinomial logistic regression. How
to obtain the p-values in Table 2? Multinomial logistic regression? Chi-square test?
5. Methods: Because the cells in Table 2 contained under <5, Fisher exact test is more suitable
than chi-square test.
6. Discussion: If the authors used the different questionnaire used in the previous study, how
and why the authors could compare the results?
7. Conclusions: Is there any evidence that training courses in EN management improve clinical
outcomes? Based on the results of your study, the only thing the authors revealed was that
low SES was associated with inadequate knowledge. Experience and training courses were
not associated with improved knowledge. Therefore, the conclusion should be based on
their results.

COMMENT # 1: Introduction: Please clearly state “what is unknown” in their topic. It is
unclear why the authors did this study.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. We agree with your comment that it was unclear
in the introduction why the authors conducted the study, but it is stated clearly in the
abstract.
Please refer to lines 2–4 in the background section. In response to your comment, we have
clarified in the introduction why the authors conducted this study. Please see paragraph 4,
lines 10, 11, and 12 of the introduction.
COMMENT # 2: Methods: Sample size determination: I’m not familiar with the equation the
authors used. Can the authors provide the reference to support this sample size calculation?
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. The equation we used to determine sample size
in our study was found in many textbooks and cited by many other previous studies. We
have included a reference according to your comment. Please see sample size
determination section, lines 3.
COMMENT # 3: Methods: Did the authors use the questionnaire, which was previously
developed, or which was newly created? If the authors use the questionnaire which was
newly created, how and why the authors could define that a score of 50% or less was
considered inadequate, 51–75% moderate, while 76% and above was considered adequate.
The cut-off score should be carefully selected.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. We did, in fact, use an adapted questionnaire
and didn't develop a new one. The word ""developed"" is used incorrectly in this statement (A
self-administered questionnaire was developed). We have changed the word “developed” by
“adapted” to be clear. In addition, we have added cited studies based on Reviewer 2's
comment. Please see study instrument section, lines 2.
The cut-off score used in this study as a scoring system was determined by previous studies
rather than by the authors themselves. We already included the reference (Reference #22).
Furthermore, many previous studies used a Bloom-based knowledge scoring system, we
have added one of these studies. Please see the reference #23.
COMMENT # 4: Methods: Please clearly describe how to perform the multinomial logistic
regression. How to obtain the p-values in Table 2? Multinomial logistic regression? Chi-
square test?
Page 16 of 22F1000Research 2022, 9:759 Last updated: 05 JUL 2023
RESPONSE: Thank you for your insightful observation and comment. In fact, we did not use
multinomial logistic regression in our data analysis; instead, we used the Chi-square test to
determine the relationships between ICU nurses' knowledge and the selected socio-
demographic variables and obtain p-values. Based on your valuable input and that of
Reviewer 2, the phrase ""multinomial logistic regression"" has been removed, and the
analysis statement has been corrected. Please see data analysis section, lines 4.
COMMENT # 5: Methods: Because the cells in Table 2 contained under <5, Fisher exact test
is more suitable than chi-square test.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. We fully agree with you. We use the Fisher exact
test to re-analyze the data in this table and re-write the table results accordingly. Please see
Table 2. Please also see line 4 for the addition of this test to the data analysis section.
COMMENT # 6: Discussion: If the authors used the different questionnaire used in the
previous study, how and why the authors could compare the results?
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. Our questionnaire was not significantly different
from those used in previous studies. We simply modified an existing questionnaire rather
than creating a new one. As a result, we compared our study findings to those of related
studies with similar intended outcomes.
COMMENT # 7: Conclusions: Is there any evidence that training courses in EN management
improve clinical outcomes? Based on the results of your study, the only thing the authors
revealed was that low SES was associated with inadequate knowledge. Experience and
training courses were not associated with improved knowledge. Therefore, the conclusion
should be based on their results.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. Thank you for your comment. Our conclusion is
derived from our results and there is no sentence implied that training courses in EN
management improve clinical outcomes but improve the awareness and knowledge. this is
what we concluded based on our findings and this is supported by many previous studies.
Please see our conclusion section.
COMMENT # 8: Discussion: What is new in this study? What can the readers act from this
paper all over the world?
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. This study, like many others around the world,
has clear objectives. These are stated clearly at the end of the introduction section.
These are explicitly stated at the end of the introduction. According to the study findings,
we believe that the situation regarding Yemeni nurses' enteral nutrition care knowledge
becomes clear. This would help decision makers develop a plan to fill this knowledge gap,
and as a result, Yemeni nurses' knowledge would grow professionally, and they would be
able to provide safe health care services. Furthermore, the findings of this study will serve
as a data base for future research and will provide potential readers with information about
the current situation of Yemen's nurses. We've added a paragraph to explain the study's

Abstract:
○ The results part in the abstract should focus on the main results such as the areas with high
level of knowledge and areas with lower level of knowledge. Remove the excessive
description of the sample socio-demographic characteristic.
○ Conclusion part has been written as a recommendation only. It will be better if you
summarize the findings then make a brief recommendation.
Methods:
○ Under the setting subtitle no need to mention the names of the hospitals. Maintaining the
confidentiality of participant hospitals. No need to mention the duration of the study under
the setting subtitle, it is mentioned under data collection.
○ Delete this ‘According to Al-Hawaly, Ibrahim, and Qalawa’ and write : according to a
previous study(..) ….
○ Instead of citing the tool they have developed and used, authors must mention and cite the
references and literature that had been used in developing the tool.
○ Per authors, the second part of data collection instrument contains three subsections which
are the before EN administration, during EN administration, and after EN administration.
Accepting that this categorization is correct, it is not clear which items are under each
subsection. Moreover, most of the 17 items are not related to the before, during, and after
EN management, they are related to general knowledge about the EN (such as the
Page 18 of 22F1000Research 2022, 9:759 Last updated: 05 JUL 2023
indications, goals, benefits, complications, routs, methods, types and contents of EN
formula, …….. etc.), even there is an item asking about the types of nutritional support in
general (enteral, parenteral, combination, ..etc.). More suitable grouping and categorizing
must be used to organize the instrument or to leave it without any categorization it will be
better.
○ Validity and reliability: delete the word ‘ reliability’ and replace it by ‘ internal consistency’.
○ Under the data analysis subtitle, they mentioned that a multinomial logistic regression test
was conducted. In fact, no multinomial logistic regression test was done. So , delete ‘
multinomial logistic regression’.
Results:
○ In results, the use of some terms (such as most, majority) in describing the results need a
revision. For example: 49.40% is not a majority.
○ Table 2 presents the frequency and percentage of the participants and compares between
the subgroups using the Chi-square tests. I think it will be better if the table presents the
knowledge means scores and standard deviations of the subgroups and compare between
them by the t or f tests. After that multiple regression can be performed.
Discussion:
○ Discussion must be on the main important findings based on the objectives of the study. No
need to write two paragraphs at the beginning of the discussion about the participants'
characteristics such as age, gender, educational levels, and work experience. Describing
those characteristic in results part is enough.

COMMENT # 1: Abstract: The results part in the abstract should focus on the main results
such as the areas with high level of knowledge and areas with lower level of knowledge.
Remove the excessive description of the sample socio-demographic characteristic.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. The results section has been rewritten based on
your recommendation. Please see the abstract's results section.
COMMENT # 2: Conclusion part has been written as a recommendation only. It will be
better if you summarize the findings then make a brief recommendation.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. Indeed, the findings were summarized in the
results section, and the conclusion section focused on the main result, the knowledge gap,
and the recommendations based on that result.
COMMENT # 3: Methods: Under the setting subtitle no need to mention the names of the
hospitals. Maintaining the confidentiality of participant hospitals. No need to mention the
duration of the study under the setting subtitle, it is mentioned under data collection.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. We have followed your recommendations.
COMMENT # 4: Delete this ‘According to Al-Hawaly, Ibrahim, and Qalawa’ and write :
according to a previous study(..)
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. We have followed your recommendations.
COMMENT # 5: Instead of citing the tool they have developed and used, authors must
mention and cite the references and literature that had been used in developing the tool.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. The references for adapted tool were cited as
recommended.
COMMENT # 6: Per authors, the second part of data collection instrument contains three
subsections which are the before EN administration, during EN administration, and after EN
Page 20 of 22F1000Research 2022, 9:759 Last updated: 05 JUL 2023
administration. Accepting that this categorization is correct, it is not clear which items are
under each subsection. Moreover, most of the 17 items are not related to the before,
during, and after EN management, they are related to general knowledge about the EN
(such as the indications, goals, benefits, complications, routs, methods, types and contents
of EN formula, ........ etc.), even there is an item asking about the types of nutritional support
in general (enteral, parenteral, combination, ..etc.). More suitable grouping and categorizing
must be used to organize the instrument or to leave it without any categorization it will be
better.
Instead of citing the tool they have developed and used, authors must mention and cite the
references and literature that had been used in developing the tool.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. The items under each subsection were
mentioned to be clear for the potential readers. We also replace the word ""management"" by
""care"" to be consistent with the general knowledge about the care of EN.
COMMENT # 7: Validity and reliability: delete the word ‘reliability’ and replace it by ‘internal
consistency’.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. We removed the word ""reliability"" and replaced it
with ""internal consistency.""
COMMENT # 8: Under the data analysis subtitle, they mentioned that a multinomial logistic
regression test was conducted. In fact, no multinomial logistic regression test was done. So,
delete ‘multinomial logistic regression’.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. We apologize for mistyping a multinomial logistic
regression test. We have removed the term ""multinomial logistic regression"".
COMMENT # 9: Results: In results, the use of some terms (such as most, majority) in
describing the results need a revision. For example: 49.40% is not a majority.
RESPONSE: Thank you for the comment. We have corrected some terms as recommended.
COMMENT # 10: Table 2 presents the frequency and percentage of the participants and
compares between the subgroups using the Chi-square tests. I think it will be better if the
table presents the knowledge means scores and standard deviations of the subgroups and
compare between them by the t or f tests. After that multiple regression can be performed.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. Following the recommendation of Reviewer 1, we
re-analyze the data in Table 2 using the Fisher exact test rather than the Chi-square test.
Please see Table 2.
COMMENT # 11: Discussion: Discussion must be on the main important findings based on
the objectives of the study. No need to write two paragraphs at the beginning of the
discussion about the participants' characteristics such as age, gender, educational levels,
and work experience. Describing those characteristic in results part is enough.

RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. Based on your recommendation, the two
paragraphs about socio-demographic characteristics were removed from the discussion

The manuscript ""Intensive care nurses' knowledge of enteral nutrition at public hospitals in
Sana'a, Yemen: a cross-sectional survey"" by Talal Ali Hussein Al-Qalah, et al. is a descriptive cross-
sectional study from four public hospitals in the capital city of Yemen. The authors intended to
assess the level of ICU nurses’ knowledge regarding the management of enteral nutrition. The
authors recruit 174 nurses in 2019. The authors found that 46% of them had an inadequate level
of knowledge regarding enteral nutrition management. From my impressions, the aim of this
study may not be interested in countries other than Yemen.
1. Introduction: Please clearly state “what is unknown” in their topic. It is unclear why the
authors did this study.
2. Methods: Sample size determination: I’m not familiar with the equation the authors used.
Can the authors provide the reference to support this sample size calculation?
3. Methods: Did the authors use the questionnaire which was previously developed or which
was newly created? If the authors use the questionnaire which was newly created, how and
why the authors could define that a score of 50% or less was considered inadequate,
51–75% moderate, while 76% and above was considered adequate. The cut-off score should
be carefully selected.
4. Methods: Please clearly describe how to perform the multinomial logistic regression. How
to obtain the p-values in Table 2? Multinomial logistic regression? Chi-square test?
5. Methods: Because the cells in Table 2 contained under <5, Fisher exact test is more suitable
than chi-square test.
6. Discussion: If the authors used the different questionnaire used in the previous study, how
and why the authors could compare the results?
Page 10 of 18F1000Research 2020, 9:759 Last updated: 05 JUL 2023
7. Conclusions: Is there any evidence that training courses in EN management improve clinical
outcomes? Based on the results of your study, the only thing the authors revealed was that
low SES was associated with inadequate knowledge. Experience and training courses were
not associated with improved knowledge. Therefore, the conclusion should be based on
their results.
8. Discussion: What is new in this study? What can the readers act from this paper all over the
world?
Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?
Partly
Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?
Partly
Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?
Partly
If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?
Partly
Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?
Partly
Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?
Partly
Competing Interests: No competing interests were disclosed.

COMMENT # 1: Introduction: Please clearly state “what is unknown” in their topic. It is
unclear why the authors did this study.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. We agree with your comment that it was unclear
in the introduction why the authors conducted the study, but it is stated clearly in the
abstract.
Please refer to lines 2–4 in the background section. In response to your comment, we have
Page 11 of 18F1000Research 2020, 9:759 Last updated: 05 JUL 2023
clarified in the introduction why the authors conducted this study. Please see paragraph 4,
lines 10, 11, and 12 of the introduction.
COMMENT # 2: Methods: Sample size determination: I’m not familiar with the equation the
authors used. Can the authors provide the reference to support this sample size calculation?
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. The equation we used to determine sample size
in our study was found in many textbooks and cited by many other previous studies. We
have included a reference according to your comment. Please see sample size
determination section, lines 3.
COMMENT # 3: Methods: Did the authors use the questionnaire, which was previously
developed, or which was newly created? If the authors use the questionnaire which was
newly created, how and why the authors could define that a score of 50% or less was
considered inadequate, 51–75% moderate, while 76% and above was considered adequate.
The cut-off score should be carefully selected.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. We did, in fact, use an adapted questionnaire
and didn't develop a new one. The word ""developed"" is used incorrectly in this statement (A
self-administered questionnaire was developed). We have changed the word “developed” by
“adapted” to be clear. In addition, we have added cited studies based on Reviewer 2's
comment. Please see study instrument section, lines 2.
The cut-off score used in this study as a scoring system was determined by previous studies
rather than by the authors themselves. We already included the reference (Reference #22).
Furthermore, many previous studies used a Bloom-based knowledge scoring system, we
have added one of these studies. Please see the reference #23.
COMMENT # 4: Methods: Please clearly describe how to perform the multinomial logistic
regression. How to obtain the p-values in Table 2? Multinomial logistic regression? Chi-
square test?
RESPONSE: Thank you for your insightful observation and comment. In fact, we did not use
multinomial logistic regression in our data analysis; instead, we used the Chi-square test to
determine the relationships between ICU nurses' knowledge and the selected socio-
demographic variables and obtain p-values. Based on your valuable input and that of
Reviewer 2, the phrase ""multinomial logistic regression"" has been removed, and the
analysis statement has been corrected. Please see data analysis section, lines 4.
COMMENT # 5: Methods: Because the cells in Table 2 contained under <5, Fisher exact test
is more suitable than chi-square test.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. We fully agree with you. We use the Fisher exact
test to re-analyze the data in this table and re-write the table results accordingly. Please see
Table 2. Please also see line 4 for the addition of this test to the data analysis section.
COMMENT # 6: Discussion: If the authors used the different questionnaire used in the
Page 12 of 18F1000Research 2020, 9:759 Last updated: 05 JUL 2023
previous study, how and why the authors could compare the results?
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. Our questionnaire was not significantly different
from those used in previous studies. We simply modified an existing questionnaire rather
than creating a new one. As a result, we compared our study findings to those of related
studies with similar intended outcomes.
COMMENT # 7: Conclusions: Is there any evidence that training courses in EN management
improve clinical outcomes? Based on the results of your study, the only thing the authors
revealed was that low SES was associated with inadequate knowledge. Experience and
training courses were not associated with improved knowledge. Therefore, the conclusion
should be based on their results.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. Thank you for your comment. Our conclusion is
derived from our results and there is no sentence implied that training courses in EN
management improve clinical outcomes but improve the awareness and knowledge. this is
what we concluded based on our findings and this is supported by many previous studies.
Please see our conclusion section.
COMMENT # 8: Discussion: What is new in this study? What can the readers act from this
paper all over the world?
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. This study, like many others around the world,
has clear objectives. These are stated clearly at the end of the introduction section.
These are explicitly stated at the end of the introduction. According to the study findings,
we believe that the situation regarding Yemeni nurses' enteral nutrition care knowledge
becomes clear. This would help decision makers develop a plan to fill this knowledge gap,
and as a result, Yemeni nurses' knowledge would grow professionally, and they would be
able to provide safe health care services. Furthermore, the findings of this study will serve
as a data base for future research and will provide potential readers with information about
the current situation of Yemen's nurses. We've added a paragraph to explain the study's
implications. Please see the discussion section, paragraph 4, Lines 1-6.

Abstract:
○ The results part in the abstract should focus on the main results such as the areas with high
level of knowledge and areas with lower level of knowledge. Remove the excessive
description of the sample socio-demographic characteristic.
○ Conclusion part has been written as a recommendation only. It will be better if you
summarize the findings then make a brief recommendation.
Methods:
○ Under the setting subtitle no need to mention the names of the hospitals. Maintaining the
confidentiality of participant hospitals. No need to mention the duration of the study under
the setting subtitle, it is mentioned under data collection.
○ Delete this ‘According to Al-Hawaly, Ibrahim, and Qalawa’ and write : according to a
previous study(..) ….
○ Instead of citing the tool they have developed and used, authors must mention and cite the
references and literature that had been used in developing the tool.
○ Per authors, the second part of data collection instrument contains three subsections which
are the before EN administration, during EN administration, and after EN administration.
Accepting that this categorization is correct, it is not clear which items are under each
subsection. Moreover, most of the 17 items are not related to the before, during, and after
EN management, they are related to general knowledge about the EN (such as the
indications, goals, benefits, complications, routs, methods, types and contents of EN
formula, …….. etc.), even there is an item asking about the types of nutritional support in
general (enteral, parenteral, combination, ..etc.). More suitable grouping and categorizing
must be used to organize the instrument or to leave it without any categorization it will be
better.
○ Validity and reliability: delete the word ‘ reliability’ and replace it by ‘ internal consistency’.
○ Under the data analysis subtitle, they mentioned that a multinomial logistic regression test
was conducted. In fact, no multinomial logistic regression test was done. So , delete ‘
multinomial logistic regression’.
Results:
○ In results, the use of some terms (such as most, majority) in describing the results need a
revision. For example: 49.40% is not a majority.
○ Table 2 presents the frequency and percentage of the participants and compares between
the subgroups using the Chi-square tests. I think it will be better if the table presents the
knowledge means scores and standard deviations of the subgroups and compare between
them by the t or f tests. After that multiple regression can be performed.
Page 14 of 18F1000Research 2020, 9:759 Last updated: 05 JUL 2023
Discussion:
○ Discussion must be on the main important findings based on the objectives of the study. No
need to write two paragraphs at the beginning of the discussion about the participants'
characteristics such as age, gender, educational levels, and work experience. Describing
those characteristic in results part is enough.
General

RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. Indeed, the findings were summarized in the
results section, and the conclusion section focused on the main result, the knowledge gap,
and the recommendations based on that result.
COMMENT # 3: Methods: Under the setting subtitle no need to mention the names of the
hospitals. Maintaining the confidentiality of participant hospitals. No need to mention the
duration of the study under the setting subtitle, it is mentioned under data collection.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. We have followed your recommendations.
COMMENT # 4: Delete this ‘According to Al-Hawaly, Ibrahim, and Qalawa’ and write :
according to a previous study(..)
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. We have followed your recommendations.
COMMENT # 5: Instead of citing the tool they have developed and used, authors must
mention and cite the references and literature that had been used in developing the tool.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. The references for adapted tool were cited as
recommended.
COMMENT # 6: Per authors, the second part of data collection instrument contains three
subsections which are the before EN administration, during EN administration, and after EN
administration. Accepting that this categorization is correct, it is not clear which items are
under each subsection. Moreover, most of the 17 items are not related to the before,

must be used to organize the instrument or to leave it without any categorization it will be
better.
Instead of citing the tool they have developed and used, authors must mention and cite the
references and literature that had been used in developing the tool.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. The items under each subsection were
mentioned to be clear for the potential readers. We also replace the word ""management"" by
""care"" to be consistent with the general knowledge about the care of EN.
COMMENT # 7: Validity and reliability: delete the word ‘reliability’ and replace it by ‘internal
consistency’.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. We removed the word ""reliability"" and replaced it
with ""internal consistency.""

COMMENT # 8: Under the data analysis subtitle, they mentioned that a multinomial logistic
regression test was conducted. In fact, no multinomial logistic regression test was done. So,
delete ‘multinomial logistic regression’.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. We apologize for mistyping a multinomial logistic
regression test. We have removed the term ""multinomial logistic regression"".
COMMENT # 9: Results: In results, the use of some terms (such as most, majority) in
describing the results need a revision. For example: 49.40% is not a majority.
RESPONSE: Thank you for the comment. We have corrected some terms as recommended.
COMMENT # 10: Table 2 presents the frequency and percentage of the participants and
compares between the subgroups using the Chi-square tests. I think it will be better if the
table presents the knowledge means scores and standard deviations of the subgroups and
compare between them by the t or f tests. After that multiple regression can be performed.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. Following the recommendation of Reviewer 1, we
re-analyze the data in Table 2 using the Fisher exact test rather than the Chi-square test.
Please see Table 2.
COMMENT # 11: Discussion: Discussion must be on the main important findings based on
the objectives of the study. No need to write two paragraphs at the beginning of the
discussion about the participants' characteristics such as age, gender, educational levels,
and work experience. Describing those characteristic in results part is enough.
RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. Based on your recommendation, the two
paragraphs about socio-demographic characteristics were removed from the discussion
section.

Thank you for submitting this interesting paper. However, I am not sure regarding the rationale -
although you have highlighted this at the beginning of the paper - but even more unlikely
currently with travel bans, etc., as a result of COVID-19. This is because I believe Ebola is currently
confined to the Congo (and hopefully now reducing) with ongoing steps in the neighbouring
countries to prevent the infection spreading. I am not sure therefore of the hypothetical situation
regarding Ebola in Indonesia - so good to discuss this more to put the findings into context.
This is because we have seen similar WTP approaches in Brazil for hypothetical and potential
vaccines in key infectious disease areas (different to the situation in Indonesia currently with
Ebola), with the need to balance the availability of the vaccine against other protective measures -
so good to expand on this in the Introduction. Refs include: (i) Godoi IP et al. Consumer
Willingness to Pay for Dengue Vaccine (CYD-TDV, Dengvaxia(R)) in Brazil; Implications for Future
Pricing Considerations1; Muniz Júnior RL et al. Consumer willingness to pay for a hypothetical Zika
vaccine in Brazil and the implications. Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research2
and Sarmento TTR et al. Consumer willingness to pay for a hypothetical chikungunya vaccine in
Brazil and the implications. Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research3. This
builds also on studies discussing the economic impact, etc., of infectious diseases such as dengue
- Godoi IP et al. Economic and epidemiological impact of dengue illness over 16 years from a
public health system perspective in Brazil to inform future health policies including the adoption
of a dengue vaccine. Expert review of vaccines4.
In addition - good to compare the findings and differences in WTP between different groups for
the Ebola vaccine in Indonesia and Brazil as both middle income countries. This can include
difference in WTP for a vaccine and any potential rationale. This is very different to just
concentrating on e.g. US nationals in West Africa - with very different income levels in Brazil - more
akin to Indonesia.

Firstly, I give you a big praise for all the efforts you made in the paper. This is a well-designed
study with appropriate methods and explicit results so this paper should be accepted. However,
there are minor points that should be clarify to improve your paper.
The following are my comments on your manuscript:
1. The manuscript needs the use of a language editing service. Mistakes in grammar were
made, in some cases, even the meaning got lost.
2. The Introduction should be strengthened. I did not see the importance of getting vaccine
against Ebola in this part.
3. Although the aim of the study was to “investigate community WTP of Ebola”, only patients’
family members were recruited. I think the study subjects did not consistent with its
objective. Perhaps, you should consider to change the term “community WTP” into more
suitable one.
4. I know you used contingent valuation method to investigate the WTP even though no
information provided. I think you should name the method and the technique used for a
better understanding.
5. Please give more explanation: how did you set the range of vaccine price?
6. Please give more explanation: why did you collapse participant into three groups of age?
Did they have any significance?
7. I do not think you should define all the variables in the section “Explanatory variables”.
Readers can find the groups of each variable in the Table. Please be shortened.
8. Please give more explanation: why did you set the cut-off point of 75% to divide attitude and
knowledge into “good” and “poor”?
9. Please cite the reference for this information: “all explanatory variables that had P > 0.25 in
this model were excluded from final linear regression model.
10. You said that you had provided information to the Ebola disease prior to assess WTP. I
wonder if this step would affect questions regarding the knowledge about Ebola, therefore
affect the WTP. Please consider carefully if you still want to state this step on the paper.
11. One of your finding is that higher education associated with higher WTP but the knowledge
did not. I think you should give more discussion on this interesting finding.
Page 12 of 17F1000Research 2019, 8:1441 Last updated: 14 JUN 2023
12. In discussion section, you should state more about benefits of WTP assessment on the
economic evaluation. Please add this statement on your discussion: “…WTP is a commonly
used method in economic evaluation pf healthcare interventions. In cost-benefit analysis,
the WTP method can value both the indirect and intangible aspects of a disease or
condition. In cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analysis, WTP is consider to be a reference
value to assess if an intervention is cost-effective or not1. It is important to be aware of
methodology and interpretation of results because of affecting to decision of policy maker
and also affecting in national expanded program in immunization on adding new good
vaccines2.”
13. In limitation, you should state that this study did not explore the effects of vaccine efficacy
on WTP values. Please add this statement under limitation: “This study did not explore the
WTP difference between two or more scenarios of vaccine with different efficacy. As could
be seen in previous study, higher efficacy of vaccines resulted in higher value of WTP3,4,5”

For novel vaccines (e.g., Ebola vaccines), WTP was often considered as a major factor of vaccine
policy and innovation1,2. Several studies have examined WTP for an Ebola vaccine in Ebola-
affected countries (e.g., West Africa3,4,5 and America6. This study in Indonesia helped to
supplement and enrich WTP for an Ebola vaccine in non-Ebola- affected countries.
However, there are several significant omissions in study design from this manuscript.
1. Although this study aimed to investigate community WTP for Ebola vaccine in Indonesia, the
selection of respondents (patients’ family members who visited outpatient departments)
caused selection bias.
2. This study was conducted in Aceh province, Indonesia. Aceh comprises predominantly rural
areas7, which might result in the skewed distribution of participants’ characteristics,
including Education (Senior high school: 47.2%), Occupation (Farmer: 26.7%) and (Suburb:
85.8%). As a result, some conclusions that high educational attainment, working as a private
employee, entrepreneur or civil servant (compared to farmers) and residing in a suburb
(compared to a city) were associated with higher WTP could not exclude the influence of
these skewness distributions.
3. The authors stated that, “Prior to assessing their WTP, participants were provided with an
introduction to the Ebola disease including the symptoms and modes of transmission.”
Although there were no Ebola cases reported in Indonesia, some respondents were still
likely to learn about Ebola and Ebola vaccines in a variety of ways, such as the Internet or
newspapers. In addition, knowledge of vaccines had proven to be one of the crucial
variables affecting WTP7. Therefore, this intervention would bias the outcome of WTP, which
did not reflect the real WTP of respondents.

Thank you for inviting me to reviewing the paper “Willingness-to-pay for a hypothetical Ebola
vaccine in Indonesia: A cross-sectional study in Ace”. This is an important and well written paper
with sound methodology. I have the following recommendations to improve this paper.
1. Under discussion, the authors stated that, “However, we found no relationship between
knowledge and WTP. It is interesting to discuss why knowledge on Ebola was not
significantly associated with WTP in this present study, but higher education was.” The
authors should state that knowledge on an infectious disease provided health professional
was found to be associated with WTP. Please add the following statement:
…. but higher education was. It could due to the observation that only knowledge on an
infectious disease provided health professional was found to be associated with WTP for
vaccine.1
2. Under limitation, the authors should state that this study did not explore on the effect of
insurance on WTP. Please add the following statement under limitation:
….. some questions given included in WTP section. This study did not explore the effect of
health insurance on WTP as previous study found that having health insurance were
associated with WTP for vaccine.2

Measures
Thesurveycollectedparticipants’demographicsandhealthinformationandassessedHCPs’attitudeandperception
ofCOVID-19andCOVID-19vaccines.Furthermore,thesurveyassessedtheHCPs’willingnesstoreceiveCOVID-19
vaccines as well as hesitancy level as measured by the vaccine hesitancy scale (VHS). The VHS includes 10 items
measuredona5-pointLikertscalerangingfromstronglydisagreetostronglyagree.TheVHSisdevelopedbytheWHO

Statisticalanalysis

COVID-19 vaccines and their demographic characteristics, awareness, and health status. The differences in the VHS
betweenparticipantswhoreportedtheirwillingnesstoreceivethevaccineandthosewhohadnointentiontoreceivethe
vaccineweredeterminedbyttests.Subsequently,weemployedmultivariatelogisticregressiontoidentifythepossiblefactors
affectingHCPs’willingnesstoreceivetheCOVID-19vaccines.Basedonmultiplepreviousstudiesthatexploredvaccines’
acceptance,18,20,22severalsociodemographicfactors(e.g.,age,residencyprovince,andhealthprofession),healthstatus,and
perception of COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines were included in the multivariable regression model. For the above
regression,oddsratio(OR)andtherespective95%CIwereestimated.AllanalyseswereperformedusingSPSS26.0(IBM

Themainfindingofthisstudywasthat9.3%oftheHCPseitherdidn’twanttoreceivethevaccineorwerehesitantto

seriousissue.Althoughtherearefewstudiesassessedthehesitancytowardvaccination,ourresultsareconsistentwiththe
currentliterature.25,26Civeleketal.(2021)foundthat68.4%ofphysiciansinTurkeywerewillingtogetvaccinated.25
Robertsonetal.(2021)reportedthat82%ofUKpopulationwerewillingtogetvaccinated.26However,willingnesslevel

attributed to several factors, but onemajor factor was that the government of Saudi Arabia prohibited unvaccinated
people from traveling, entering private establishments and government buildings, or performing Hajj and Umrah.29
However,ourresultsshowedthat23%ofHCPswerehesitanttoreceivethevaccine.Notreceivingthevaccinewill

However,theincreaseddemandonhealthcareservicesduringthepandemicwiththesevereshortagesinHCPsmake
it very challenging to comply with those measures. This is complicated by to the difficulty in implementing social

Ourstudyshowedthatthemajorityofthosewhoagreedtoreceivethevaccinewereyoung,upto24years.Thisresultis

Limitations
Thisstudyhassomelimitations.First,althoughthesamplesizeinourstudywasobjectivelydetermined,weuseda
snowball sampling method to distribute the survey link among HCPs in the KSA. This method may have caused a
selection bias since most of our sample were from the eastern province of KSA. Therefore, our sample may not be
representativeofallHCPsinKSA,whichcanlimitthegeneralizabilityofthefindings.Inaddition,thiswasacross-
sectional study. Therefore, we could not draw causal relationships between the factors and COVID-19 vaccine
acceptance. Finally, the study's questionnaire was published online in the English language only, which produced a
selectionbiasfavoringEnglish-literateHCPsonlyandthosewhohaveInternetconnections.

Dear Reviewer, Thanks for the feedback.
1- This manuscript mainly investigated the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and intentions
among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia. There have been many similar investigations, so
the authors should compare their work with the published data and provide explanation of
Page 15 of 19F1000Research 2022, 11:24 Last updated: 27 SEP 2023
possible discrepancy.
In the discussion section we compared our findings with the other studies conducted
in Saudi Arabia and other countries and explained the differences.
2- Only 505 valid participants were investigated in this survey. Please state how to calculate
the minimum sample size of participants in this survey.
There was no calculation of the minimum sample size in this study since we used a
simplified-snowball sampling technique. The invited participants were requested to
share the invitation link with their WhatsApp contacts and other social media
platforms. Our data collection period was predetermined by certain dates. We stopped
the data collection once we reach the predetermined date and reached a sample size
close to a previous study conducted in Saudi Arabia by Qattan et al. in 2021 where they
received 673 completed responses.
3- Please also state the inclusion and exclusion criteria for these participants in this survey.
Selection bias may exist if the participants with small sample size were recruited without
reasonable inclusion and exclusion criteria.
We have mentioned the inclusion criteria for this study in the Participants section “All
HCPs currently working in healthcare facilities in KSA, regardless of the level of
patient contact and their clinical role, were eligible to participate in the study.” No
exclusion criteria were stated.
4- The study was conducted in April, 2021, but the pandemic situation and vaccination
policies changed greatly during this year. This change always influenced people’s attitudes
towards COVID-19 vaccination, and therefore the conclusion might be changed.
Yes, agree. We aimed to investigate vaccine acceptance in Saudi Arabia wright after
the approval of the COVID-19 vaccines. Prior studies were already conducted before
this milestone which provided different prospective and conclusion. However, more
studies need to be conducted after the changes in the pandemic situation and the
policies which have influenced HCPs’ attitude toward the vaccines.
Thank You.
Competing Interests: No competing interests were disclosed.

Dear authors,
Thank you for your submission of your article entitled “Hesitancy towards the COVID-19 vaccine
among health care practitioners in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: a cross-sectional study” for
F1000Research.
Here are some comments for improvement. I hope these comments are useful!
Title: your study aims to measure willingness and hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccines among
health care practitioners (HCPs) in Saudi Arabia. However, ""willingness"" is conspicuously absent
from the title; I suggest adding the willingness to the title.
Introduction
Due to massive changes in the number of cases every day, mentioning the date you got the
statistics increases the accuracy for the readers.
The problem statement in the introduction needs to be enriching more by mentioning:
○ The impact of COVID-19 on HCPs by presenting governmental statistics and previous
studies
○ More international and national literature on hesitancy and willingness of receiving the
vaccine
○ The motive to conduct this study in particular if we consider the high percentage
vaccination rate in Saudi Arabia and how the compensation mechanism of HCPs who are
declining to receive the vaccine is affected, as they are able and trained to protect patients
by using the safety compliance behaviours and adhering to PPE. Please see “Al-Bsheish, M.,
Jarrar, M. T., & Scarbrough, A. (2021). A Public Safety Compliance Model of Safety Behaviors
in the Age of the COVID-19 Pandemic. INQUIRY: The Journal of Health Care Organization,
Provision, and Financing, 58, 1–6”.
Methods
○ In the Participant's part, you mentioned “All adults (>18 years of age) currently working in
healthcare facilities in KSA” while your investigation is among HCPs! …This may confuse the
readers.
○ In the Measures part, you wrote “we piloted the survey with nine HCPs currently practicing
in KSA to assure the clarity of the questions and to evaluate the face and content validity of
the scale on the targeted population”, did you mean pre-test? Because you examined the
face and content validity, however, the pilot study investigates the reliability of the scale by
Cronbach's alpha, and the minimal size to conduct it is 30 participants. Please See “Sekaran,
U., & Bougie, R. (2016). Research methods for business: A skill-building approach. John Wiley
& Sons”.
Results
○ You wrote “Women were more hesitant to receive the vaccine (47.3%) compared to men”.
While Table 2 shows the willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccines. There is a difference
between willingness and hesitancy. I would change this to ""Women were less willing to
receive the vaccine"".
Page 17 of 19F1000Research 2022, 11:24 Last updated: 27 SEP 2023
Discussion
○ Well written and interesting, however, it is better to focus on the conspiracy theories in your
introduction to enrich your problem statement in this study.
○ It is better to add the limitations and future studies in separate parts after the discussion.
Lastly, please revise the manuscript for flow and English language edits and update any
references
Again, thank you for your work, and good luck.

Statisticalanalysis
Fordescriptiveanalyses,univariateanalyseswereusedtoevaluatetheassociationsbetweenHCPs’willingnesstoreceive
COVID-19vaccinesandtheirdemographiccharacteristics,awareness,andhealthstatus.ThedifferencesintheVHSbetween
participantswhoreportedtheirwillingnesstoreceivethevaccineandthosewhohadnointentiontoreceivethevaccinewere
determinedbyttests.Subsequently,weemployedmultivariatelogisticregressiontoidentifythepossiblefactorsaffecting
HCPs’ willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccines. Based on multiple previous studies that explored vaccines’
acceptance,8,9,12severalsociodemographicfactors(e.g.,age,residencyprovince,andhealthprofession),healthstatus,and
perception of COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines were included in the multivariable regression model. For the above
regression,oddsratio(OR)andtherespective95%CIwereestimated.AllanalyseswereperformedusingSPSS26.0(IBM

Thisstudyhassomelimitations.First,althoughthesamplesizeinourstudywasobjectivelydetermined,weuseda
snowball sampling method to distribute the survey link among HCPs in the KSA. This method may have caused a
selection bias since most of our sample were from the eastern province of KSA. Therefore, our sample may not be
representativeofallHCPsinKSA,whichcanlimitthegeneralizabilityofthefindings.Inaddition,thiswasacross-
sectional study. Therefore, we could not draw causal relationships between the factors and COVID-19 vaccine
acceptance. Finally, the study's questionnaire was published online in the English language only, which produced a
selectionbiasfavoringEnglish-literateHCPsonlyandthosewhohaveInternetconnections.
Despitethelimitations,ourstudywasabletoexploresomeoftheunknownfactorsassociatedwithCOVID-19vaccine
acceptance and rejection which were not explored in previous studies. Also, given the representative sample size

This manuscript mainly investigated the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and intentions among
healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia. There have been many similar investigations, so the authors
should compare their work with the published data and provide explanation of possible
discrepancy.
Only 505 valid participants were investigated in this survey. Please state how to calculate the
minimum sample size of participants in this survey.
Please also state the inclusion and exclusion criteria for these participants in this survey. Selection
bias may exist if the participants with small sample size were recruited without reasonable
inclusion and exclusion criteria.
The study was conducted in April, 2021, but the pandemic situation and vaccination policies
changed greatly during this year. This change always influenced people’s attitudes towards
COVID-19 vaccination, and therefore the conclusion might be changed.

Dear Reviewer, Thanks for the feedback.
1- This manuscript mainly investigated the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and intentions
among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia. There have been many similar investigations, so
the authors should compare their work with the published data and provide explanation of
possible discrepancy.
In the discussion section we compared our findings with the other studies conducted
in Saudi Arabia and other countries and explained the differences.
2- Only 505 valid participants were investigated in this survey. Please state how to calculate
the minimum sample size of participants in this survey.
There was no calculation of the minimum sample size in this study since we used a
simplified-snowball sampling technique. The invited participants were requested to
share the invitation link with their WhatsApp contacts and other social media
platforms. Our data collection period was predetermined by certain dates. We stopped
the data collection once we reach the predetermined date and reached a sample size
close to a previous study conducted in Saudi Arabia by Qattan et al. in 2021 where they
received 673 completed responses.
3- Please also state the inclusion and exclusion criteria for these participants in this survey.
Selection bias may exist if the participants with small sample size were recruited without
reasonable inclusion and exclusion criteria.
We have mentioned the inclusion criteria for this study in the Participants section “All
HCPs currently working in healthcare facilities in KSA, regardless of the level of
patient contact and their clinical role, were eligible to participate in the study.” No
exclusion criteria were stated.
4- The study was conducted in April, 2021, but the pandemic situation and vaccination
Page 12 of 16F1000Research 2022, 11:24 Last updated: 27 SEP 2023
policies changed greatly during this year. This change always influenced people’s attitudes
towards COVID-19 vaccination, and therefore the conclusion might be changed.
Yes, agree. We aimed to investigate vaccine acceptance in Saudi Arabia wright after
the approval of the COVID-19 vaccines. Prior studies were already conducted before
this milestone which provided different prospective and conclusion. However, more
studies need to be conducted after the changes in the pandemic situation and the
policies which have influenced HCPs’ attitude toward the vaccines.
Thank You.

Dear authors,
Thank you for your submission of your article entitled “Hesitancy towards the COVID-19 vaccine
among health care practitioners in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: a cross-sectional study” for
F1000Research.
Here are some comments for improvement. I hope these comments are useful!
Title: your study aims to measure willingness and hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccines among
health care practitioners (HCPs) in Saudi Arabia. However, ""willingness"" is conspicuously absent
from the title; I suggest adding the willingness to the title.
Introduction
Due to massive changes in the number of cases every day, mentioning the date you got the
statistics increases the accuracy for the readers.
The problem statement in the introduction needs to be enriching more by mentioning:
○ The impact of COVID-19 on HCPs by presenting governmental statistics and previous
studies
○ More international and national literature on hesitancy and willingness of receiving the
vaccine
Page 13 of 16F1000Research 2022, 11:24 Last updated: 27 SEP 2023
○ The motive to conduct this study in particular if we consider the high percentage
vaccination rate in Saudi Arabia and how the compensation mechanism of HCPs who are
declining to receive the vaccine is affected, as they are able and trained to protect patients
by using the safety compliance behaviours and adhering to PPE. Please see “Al-Bsheish, M.,
Jarrar, M. T., & Scarbrough, A. (2021). A Public Safety Compliance Model of Safety Behaviors
in the Age of the COVID-19 Pandemic. INQUIRY: The Journal of Health Care Organization,
Provision, and Financing, 58, 1–6”.
Methods
○ In the Participant's part, you mentioned “All adults (>18 years of age) currently working in
healthcare facilities in KSA” while your investigation is among HCPs! …This may confuse the
readers.
○ In the Measures part, you wrote “we piloted the survey with nine HCPs currently practicing
in KSA to assure the clarity of the questions and to evaluate the face and content validity of
the scale on the targeted population”, did you mean pre-test? Because you examined the
face and content validity, however, the pilot study investigates the reliability of the scale by
Cronbach's alpha, and the minimal size to conduct it is 30 participants. Please See “Sekaran,
U., & Bougie, R. (2016). Research methods for business: A skill-building approach. John Wiley
& Sons”.
Results
○ You wrote “Women were more hesitant to receive the vaccine (47.3%) compared to men”.
While Table 2 shows the willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccines. There is a difference
between willingness and hesitancy. I would change this to ""Women were less willing to
receive the vaccine"".
Discussion
○ Well written and interesting, however, it is better to focus on the conspiracy theories in your
introduction to enrich your problem statement in this study.
○ It is better to add the limitations and future studies in separate parts after the discussion.
Lastly, please revise the manuscript for flow and English language edits and update any
references
Again, thank you for your work, and good luck.

I would like to thank the editor for inviting me to review this manuscript. I would also like to
compliment the authors on a well-conducted study that is very relevant during the current
pandemic.
The authors have made an effort to conduct a KAP study on the public in Pakistan to evaluate their
response towards COVID-19. They conducted a survey using 1120 people for data collection and
also ran the Student's t-test and ANOVA after the data collection. They concluded that
female participants in the study had a higher awareness regarding the SARS-CoV2 pandemic and
also found out that people generally had good awareness about hand hygiene methods.
I only have a few suggestions to help improve the quality of the paper:
○ Please include a power of the sample part/discussion. Although the investigators have
taken a sample of 1120, it would be a good idea to run a power of the sample test to
demonstrate the population this sample would represent.
○ Please include a few points of collecting information online in the limitations section. Each
study has its own limitations and online surveys generally have their own limitations and
bias. Kindly elaborate on this in a separate section.
Also, you may find the following studies helpful to add to your discussion. The reason for using
these studies is they are relevant to your paper and also would help you add to the discussion and
limitations sections as both are online surveys on very closely related topics that have been
published in high-impact journals.
1. Marya et al., 20211: This study focuses on what measures are being taken to curtail the
spread of COVID-19 by dentists to ensure no contact spread or cross-contamination occurs.
Page 12 of 17F1000Research 2021, 10:946 Last updated: 30 SEP 2023
2. Albargi et al., 20212: This is a very important paper that highlights the attitude of the
patients in many situations where they do not divulge proper information regarding their
COVID-19 status. Again, this paper is very important in demonstrating the attitude of the
general public towards COVID-19.

Kindly elaborate on this in a separate section.
Response: has been elaborated.
Also, you may find the following studies helpful to add to your discussion. The reason for
using these studies is they are relevant to your paper and also would help you add to the
discussion and limitations sections as both are online surveys on very closely related topics
that have been published in high-impact journals.
Marya et al., 20211: This study focuses on what measures are being taken to curtail the
spread of COVID-19 by dentists to ensure no contact spread or cross-contamination occurs.
Albargi et al., 20212: This is a very important paper that highlights the attitude of the
patients in many situations where they do not divulge proper information regarding their
COVID-19 status. Again, this paper is very important in demonstrating the attitude of the
general public toward COVID-19.
Response: the suggested articles have been added.

UnitedStates FoodandDrugsAdministration (USFDA)defined dietary supplements(DS) assubstances containing

Practiceofdietarysupplementconsumption
Ourstudyfoundthat420(77.63%)respondentsconsumedDSduringthepost-DeltawaveoftheCOVID-19pandemic.
Forty percent reported they had never consumed DS before the pandemic. Several sociodemographic factors were
associated with DS consumption,for example, middle-aged adults were more likely to consumeDS compared with
elderly and young adults (p=0.005). Higher education, higher self-reported economic status, married status, those
diagnosedwithCOVID-19 andworkingrespondentswerealsomorelikelytoconsumeDS(p=0.004,0.011,0.000,
0.009,0.000,respectively).NostatisticallysignificantdifferenceswerefoundinDSconsumptionamongsex,domicile
and field of work/study. The frequency of supplement consumption based on their sociodemographic factors is

DeterminantsofDSconsumptionpractice
To measure predictors of DS consumption of this study, binary logistic regression was performed. For supplement
consumption,theunivariateanalysisofbinarylogisticregressionshowedrespondentswithhighereducation,working,
havingconfirmedCOVID-19status,marriedstatusandhavehigherself-reportedeconomystatusweremorelikelyto
consume DS. Using those variables, multivariate analysis of a binary logistic regression model showed significant
positivepredictorsforconsumingDSwerethehealth-relatedfieldofworkorstudy(AOR:1.733,95%CI1.109-2.709).
However, respondents reporting no confirmed COVID-19 status were less likely to consume DS (AOR 0.524,

95% CI 0.291-0.944), and as expected, respondents with a lower self-reported economic status were less likely to
consumeDSpost-DeltawaveCOVID-19pandemic(AOR0.309,95%CI0.124-0.769)provingthelackofaccessibility

Discussion
TheCOVID-19pandemichaschangedmostaspectsofhumanlifestyleincludingtheeconomy,transportationandof
course,themedicalfield.IthasbeenthreeyearssinceWHOannouncedthepandemic,anddespitedecliningcases,the
statushasnotbeenrevoked.Evennow,researchersarestillactivelyseekingandrevealingnewknowledgeonCOVID-19,
including finding preventive measures and definitive drugs for post-COVID complications and long term COVID
symptoms.DSasapreventivemeasurewashighlyinvestigatedtoavoidadvancedstagesofCOVID-19.Severalresearch
studiesalsoexploredthepossibilityofDStoreversethepathophysiologyofCOVID-19(Caballero-Garcíaetal.,2021),as
wellasacomplementarytherapyforpatientswithCOVID-19andpreventivetherapyagainstlungdiseases(Zhang&Liu,
2020).Severalstudiesincludingclinicaltrials,endeavoredtoprovethatDSeffectivelyreduceddiseaseseverity,shortened
thelengthofstayandpreventedinfectionbyboostingtheimmunesystem(Pinnawalaetal.,2021).Unfortunately,those
clinicaltrialsfailedtoproveDSabilitytodoso(Amin&Drenos,2021;Brunvolletal.,2022;Muraietal.,2021;Thomas
etal.,2021).However,increasingDSconsumptionandsaleshavebeenreportedworldwideincludingintheUS,Europe
andAsia(d’Arqometal.,2021;Hamulkaetal.,2021;Karlssonetal.,2021;Khabour&Hassanein,2021;Lordan,2021)
withself-consumptionpractice,withoutconsultationwithhealthcareprofessionals,andstillobservedinAsia,Africaand
America(d’Arqometal.,2021,(Quispe-Cañarietal.,2021;Sadioetal.,2021;Wegbometal.,2021;Yasminetal.,2022).
Even though the self-consumption of DS is considered safe, their side effects in high-risk populations, especially
individualswithseveralgeneticbackgrounds,comorbiditiesandpatientsonprescribedmedication,couldbeunpleasant.
Theymightexperienceunwantedeffectsduetodruganddiseaseinteraction(Agbabiakaetal.,2018;Asheretal.,2017;
Ekor,2014;Pengetal.,2004).
Practiceofdietarysupplementconsumptionanditspredictivefactors
OurstudyfoundincreasingDSconsumption,asmorethanthreequartersofrespondentsconsumedDSduringtheDelta
waveoftheCOVID-19pandemic,withonly59.52%consumingDSbeforetheoutbreak.Fortypercentoftherespondents
didnotconsultwithhealthcareprofessionalsbeforeconsumingDSformorethan3months.Thispracticewasalsofound
beforeandduringthepandemic,inparallelwithothersimilarstudies,suchasin1579UScitizens(Blendonetal.,2013),
105athletesinSaudiArabia(Aljaloud&Ibrahim,2013),651studentsinSaudiArabia(Almegewlyetal.,2022)and
48,925Japaneseadults(Chiba&Tanemura,2022).Thisconsumptionwassignificantlyassociatedwithmiddleage,
highereducation,highereconomicstatus,maritalstatus,receivingadiagnosisofCOVID-19andemploymentstatus.
However,ourregressionmodelshowedthatonlyhealth-relatedfieldofworkorstudywasapositivepredictivefactor,
whileneverconfirmedCOVID-19statusandlowerself-reportedeconomicstatuswerenegativepredictors.
YoungerrespondentsmightfeelhealthierandatlowerriskofobtainingseverestageofCOVID-19(Libertinietal.,2019;
Perrottaetal.,2020),whileolderrespondentsmightbeunawareoftheriskandthedisease,despitebeingmoreproneto
transmission(Wolfetal.,2020).Anotherpossiblereasonwastheymightbeunawareoftheriskofinteractionbetween
DSandtheirdiseasesordrugsconsumed(Agbabiakaetal.,2018;Alkhalidietal.,2019).However,ahighpossibility
existedthatrespondentshavingreceivedadiagnosisofCOVID-19wouldliketopreventre-infectionbyconsumingDS
(Ali,2020;Shahbazetal.,2022).MarriedandworkingrespondentsmightconsumeDSduetotheirresponsibilitiesto
avoidinfectionandneedtofulfiltheirdutiestotheirfamilymembers.ThisfindingwassimilartothestudyinIndonesia
duringthefirstyearofthepandemic(d’Arqometal.,2021),SaudiArabia(Radwanetal.,2022)andLebanon(Mohsen
etal.,2021).HighereconomicstatusrespondentswereabletobuytheDSandmighthaveahigherresponsibilityintheir
workplace;thus,theyhadconsumedDS.SimilarphenomenawerealsoreportedinIndonesiaandSaudiArabia(d’Arqom
etal.,2021;Radwanetal.,2022).Astudyon11,240USadultsfrom2011to2014alsoreportedsimilarfinding,as
consumptionofDSwashigheramongthoseearninghigherincomes(Cowanetal.,2018).
Amongthetwogroups,respondentswithnon-health-relatedbackgroundweremorelikelytoconsumeDSformorethan
three months compared with respondents with health-related backgrounds. Despite of not being in the medical and
healthcarecareerline,non-healthbackgroundrespondents’havebetterlong-termcompliance.AccordingtoBiesalski
andteam,longtermcomplianceinDSsuchasmultivitaminandmineralsupplementbringsbenefittogeneralhealthfrom
developinglifestylediseaseandwasalsodocumentedsafeinover10yearsofconsumptionintheclinicaltrial(Biesalski
&Tinz,2017).However,thismiraculousfindingdoesnotapplytoallDSs.Strangesetal.(2007)foundthatprolonged
useofselenium,aningredientcommonlyfoundinmainstreamingestiblebeautysupplements,canleadtoanincreased
riskofdevelopingtype2diabeteslaterinlife.Therefore,therearepotentialdetrimentaleffectsoflong-termcompliance

respondentsasoneofthepredictivefactorsforonlineshopping;however,theyfoundthatyoungerage,highereducation,
female,goodeconomicstatusandextendedworkinghourscomprisedpositivepredictorsforonlineshopping(Dominici
etal.,2021).Thismightbeoneofthereasons,becausehealthcareprofessionalsandmedicalstudentshavelongworking
hours (Dyrbye et al., 2017; Shreffler et al., 2020), including during the COVID-19 pandemic (Razu et al., 2021).
However,thisfindingraisesconcernsabouttheregulatorycontrolofe-commerceplatformsandphysicalstoresselling

supplementsandtheirpotentialsideeffects,e-commerceplatformsandotherstoressellingDSmaynotprovideaccessto

Knowledgeondietarysupplementsanditspredictivefactors
Moreover,ourstudyfoundthatonehalfofrespondentspossessedgoodknowledgelevelsaboutDS,withonly2%having
poorknowledge.However,ourfindingsmightbebiasedbecausealmosttwothirdsofourrespondentshadhealth-related
work/studybackgrounds.However,thecomparisonofDSknowledgeinbothgroupsshowedrespondentswithnon-
health-related backgrounds possessed less knowledge about DS, supporting our above-mentioned concern on the
purchasing habits out of drug store. This finding differed from that of 351 students in Saudi Arabia, reporting no
differencebetweentheknowledgelevelofhealthsciencestudentswiththoseofnon-healthsciencestudents(Alowais&
Selim,2019).Unfortunately,mostwerestillpartiallyunawareofthesafetyandsideeffectsofDSonthemarketandthe
necessityofDSconsumption.Thishurdlewasalsofoundamong537UShealthcareprofessionals(Kemperetal.,2003)
and179USstudentspharmacist(Axonetal.,2017).Ourstudyfoundthattheirlevelofknowledgewasnotdeterminedby
sociodemographicfactorsandDSconsumptioninthepost-deltawaveoftheCOVID-19pandemic,asnosignificant
predictorfactorswerefoundinunivariateandmultivariateanalysis.
Eventhoughsociodemographicfactorsdidnotaffecttherespondents’knowledgeofDS,weneedtobeawareabout
healthinequalitythathasbeenhighlightedduringtheCOVID-19pandemicandhasbeendiscussedextensively(McGrail
etal.,2022;Mishraetal.,2021).InIndonesiaitself,in2017,theWHOandMinistryofHealthRepublicofIndonesia
reported an existing gap on health status in Indonesia related to economic status, education level, occupation,
employmentstatus,age,sex,placeofresidenceandsubnationalregion.Thesedisparitiesincludelowconsumptionof
fruitsandvegetables,knownasthemainsourceofvitaminsandmineralsfromfood(WHO&Kemenkes,2017).Several
other studies also reported these health disparities (Haemmerli et al., 2021; Mulyanto et al., 2019). Reportedly, the
implementationofnationalcoverageinsurancehasresultedinadecreaseinhealthdisparitiesattributedtodifferencesin
economicstatus(Warsito&Adisasmito,2020).Regrettably,theCOVID-19pandemichasledtoanincreaseinsocio-
economicdisparityinurbanareas,whileruralareaswiththehighestCOVID-19caseshaveexperiencedadecrease,yet
theimpactofthistrendonhealthinequalitiesremainsunreported(Brataetal.,2021).

Eventhoughtheinternet-basedsurveywasconductedconvenientlyandefficiently,thequestionnairemightnothave
reachedtherespondentsinremoteareasofIndonesiaduetolimitedinternetaccess.Moreover,limitedinteractionwiththe
respondentsmighthavecreatedabiased responsestothequestionnaire.Furthermore,thesamplingmethodsdidnot

ThisstudyshowedthepracticesandknowledgelevelofDSconsumptioninIndonesiapost-deltawaveoftheCOVID-19

Brief summary:
The reviewed paper, titled “Practice and knowledge of dietary supplement (DS) consumption
among Indonesian adults post-delta wave of the COVID-19 pandemic” was an internet-based
survey which focused primarily on how dietary supplements was consumed by a statistically
determined group of people in Indonesia, during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as during the
post-Delta wave period. The authors utilized descriptive method of analysis to illustrate the
consumption pattern (frequency, duration, aim, preferrable dosage form), familiarity with and
side-consequences of DS among the respondents.
This is a well written paper which throws more light on the consumption of DS not only in
Indonesia but throughout the world. Other reviewers have commented extensively on the
statistical analysis and inferences in this paper. Authors should go over the syntaxes and tenses as
I have suggested in the review paper which I am submitting with comments and highlighted
sentences or words, LINK.
General Comments:
Introduction:
○ The subject matter of this manuscript, consumption of DH, is of global concern and the
period of study was a time of worldwide pandemic. Currents of vital information on these
two issues are vital to the scientific world. The introduction segment of the paper, consisting
of four paragraphs, is well written but few sentences therein require correction of
typographical errors and tenses.
○ Furthermore, the authors should probably have presented DS consumption from a wider
area of the world so that readers could have a better idea of the depth of the health
problems that the study was trying to unravel.
Method:
Page 15 of 25F1000Research 2023, 12:3 Last updated: 27 JUL 2023
○ This segment of the manuscript was divided into five segments – Study design, Participants,
Data collection, Ethical consideration, and Analytical procedures. Here, the authors should
probably have given a brief description of the study site, including the population of
Indonesia and some geographical information, if the sample size was adequate for
statistical inference, though this really depends on the response rate as this was an on-line
study.
○ One of the minor drawbacks of this section is the syntax of the last sentence in the data
collection section which has been referred to and corrected in the review.
Result:
○ The Result segment of the reviewed paper contains most of the sentences or words that
need correction. First, there is no need to express percentages beyond one decimal place.
In fact, figures are best expressed as whole numbers. This has been reflected in the
reviewed paper.
○ Secondly, some of the sentences in this segment of the paper need to be rephrased to
make sense to the readers. One minor observation was that the first column in Table 1 may
be re-arranged, putting Marital status and Economic status after Sex followed by Education,
Work, Field of work/study and lastly Confirmed COVID-19.
○ Further, Figure 1 is too compact and should probably be spread out and given a relatively
clearer explanation, especially Figures 1 C and D. Figure 1 A refers to co-morbidities of the
respondents, but this should be explained further. Is it that these disease entities occur
together in the same patient (co-morbidity) or they exist differently, in different prevalence,
among the study participants? This should be made clear to readers. The following
questions in the questionnaire needs further clarification – Q6: DSs have dangerous side
effects and Q10: DS have fewer side effects. The reason is that Q6 does not preclude Q10.
DSs fewer but dangerous side effects and fewer or more DSs can have dangerous side
effects.
Discussion:
○ It would be good to include references from different regions of the world, including Africa,
which was also ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic and where DSs are also consumed in
large quantities before, during and after the pandemic.
○ The authors quoted Biesalski & Tinz, 2017 as having a “miraculous” finding but this word –
miraculous – should be deleted from this manuscript because it is subjective, and others
may not find it miraculous. Some statements in this segment of the manuscript are
incomplete and authors have been advised to complete them in the reviewed paper.
Limitation and recommendations:
○ A statement in the second paragraph in this segment, also highlighted in yellow as others
that need correction, has been reconstructed. The authors should take a look at it and
possibly effect the recommended changes.
Overall, this is a well-written paper with good ideology. I would like to congratulate the authors for
their efforts in producing a splendid work. The authors may wish to go over the reviewed paper
and make possible changes to the areas that need correction.
Congratulations again.

Page 17 of 25F1000Research 2023, 12:3 Last updated: 27 JUL 2023
○ Questionnaire: more information is needed, especially on the validity tests. What type of
validity test was conducted?
○ How do the authors determine the eligibility of the pharmacologist, pharmacist and
psychologist to validate the questionnaire? Are 4 reviewers sufficient? Please explain with
references.
○ How do the authors determine whether the number of subjects for the pilot study is
sufficient? Please add the reference as well.
○ How did the authors determine the level of knowledge based on the score? Were any
standard classifications used, (example: Bloom’s cut off point)? Please add the explanation
and reference.
Results
○ Figure 2b describes the results from Kruskal Wallis. But the information on the use of
Kruskal Wallis is not described in the method section. Were the data not normally
distributed? Please revise accordingly.
○ Table 2 and Table 3. It is not clear on why the demographic data was not included in the
logistic regression analysis. Please describe the reason, and revise if needed. Perhaps
because it was not significant in the univariate analysis? If yes, then my suggestion is to
describe in the statistical analysis, in which to add that the significance variables in the
univariate analysis is further investigated using univariate and multivariable logistic
regression. Please revise accordingly.
○ Table 2: why are Education, Work and Marital statuses not included into the multivariable
analysis even though it is significant in the univariate regression? Why is Field included in
the multivariable logistic regression even though it is not significant in the univariate
regression?
Discussion
○ Paragraph 1: It would be good to include the examples of side effects in high risk
population, and unwanted effects dur to drug and disease interaction.
○ Paragraph 2: any potential reason for the results of regression model? It would be good to
add the explanation on the potential reason.

The manuscript presents a study focusing on the practices and knowledge level of dietary
supplement (DS) consumption in Indonesia, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic. The
authors have provided a comprehensive background on the topic and presented their findings
based on a well-structured questionnaire. However, there are certain aspects that need to be
addressed to improve the manuscript's overall quality and clarity.
Major Comments:
1. The authors mention that the study was conducted after the COVID-19 pandemic. However,
considering that the pandemic is still ongoing and that the WHO has not revoked the
pandemic status, it would be better to rephrase the context of the study as ""during the
COVID-19 pandemic"" or ""in the post-delta wave of the COVID-19 pandemic"" instead of ""after
the COVID-19 pandemic.""
2. The manuscript would benefit from a clear description of the study design, including the
sampling method, sample size, and the study period. It is essential to provide these details
to assess the study's robustness and reliability.
3. The authors should consider providing a demographic breakdown of the respondents,
including age, gender, geographic distribution, and other relevant characteristics. This
information is crucial to understand the generalizability of the study findings.
4. The authors should provide more details about the questionnaire, including how it was
developed, its validation process, and how the knowledge levels of respondents were
assessed.
Page 20 of 25F1000Research 2023, 12:3 Last updated: 27 JUL 2023
5. The authors have highlighted several limitations of the study, such as the sampling method,
questionnaire outreach, and potential bias in the responses. They should consider
discussing potential strategies to address these limitations in future studies to provide a
more comprehensive understanding of DS consumption practices and knowledge levels in
Indonesia.
6. The discussion section could be better organized by separating the key findings and relating
them to the existing literature. It is essential to highlight the novel aspects of the study and
the implications of the findings for policy and practice.
7. Given the study's focus on practices and knowledge levels, it would be helpful to include
recommendations for public health interventions to promote safe and informed DS
consumption, such as educational campaigns or regulatory measures.
Minor Comments:
1. In several instances throughout the manuscript, the authors use the term ""DS"" without
defining it first. It would be helpful to define the term ""dietary supplements"" before using
the abbreviation ""DS"" to improve readability.
2. Some sentences are lengthy and could be broken down into shorter, more concise
statements for better readability.
3. The manuscript would benefit from a thorough proofreading to correct grammatical errors,
inconsistencies in citations, and formatting issues.
In conclusion, the manuscript presents an interesting study examining the practices and
knowledge level of dietary supplement consumption in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, several aspects need to be addressed to improve the manuscript's quality and clarity. By
addressing these concerns, the authors can present a more robust and reliable study that
contributes to the understanding of dietary supplement consumption in the context of the
ongoing pandemic.

Response to Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author
The manuscript presents a study focusing on the practices and knowledge level of dietary
supplement (DS) consumption in Indonesia, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic. The
authors have provided a comprehensive background on the topic and presented their
findings based on a well-structured questionnaire. However, there are certain aspects that
need to be addressed to improve the manuscript's overall quality and clarity.
Major Comments:
1. The authors mention that the study was conducted after the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, considering that the pandemic is still ongoing and that the WHO has not revoked
the pandemic status, it would be better to rephrase the context of the study as ""during the
COVID-19 pandemic"" or ""in the post-delta wave of the COVID-19 pandemic"" instead of ""after
the COVID-19 pandemic.""
Response: Thank you very much for bringing up this matter. We change the sentences into post-
delta wave of the COVID-19 pandemic as in the line 350 and 354.
2. The manuscript would benefit from a clear description of the study design, including the
sampling method, sample size, and the study period. It is essential to provide these details
to assess the study's robustness and reliability.
Response: Thank you very much for pointing out this issue. We did mention the sampling
methods and the study period in the line 52-55 (“The questionnaire was distributed to the adult
population in Indonesia through email and social media using convenience sampling methods
from October to December 2021, and multiple responds from single device were prevented based
on respondents’ IP address.”); and the sample size in the line 62-65 (“Sample size was calculated
using sample size calculator ( www.raosoft.com) with 5% margin of error, 95% confidence level,
and population number filled with 100,000, resulting in 383 minimum respondents.”).

3. The authors should consider providing a demographic breakdown of the respondents,
including age, gender, geographic distribution, and other relevant characteristics. This
information is crucial to understand the generalizability of the study findings.
Response: Thank you very much for your suggestion. The sociodemographic characteristic of the
respondents was provided in table 1.
4. The authors should provide more details about the questionnaire, including how it was
developed, its validation process, and how the knowledge levels of respondents were
assessed.
Response: Thank you very much for bringing up this matter. We did mention about the
development of the questionnaire and the validation process as in the line 78-88 (“The
questionnaire was modified from the Prevalence and Awareness Concerning Dietary Supplement
Use among Saudi Adolescents ( Alfawaz et al., 2020) and Knowledge about dietary supplements
and trust in advertising them: Development and validation of the questionnaires and preliminary
results of the association between the constructs ( Karbownik et al., 2019). The questionnaire was
combined and validated by two pharmacologists, a pharmacist, and a psychologist, and was
further tested on 20 respondents to ensure that the content and terms used in the questionnaire
were relevant and understandable. The reliability measurement on the survey data showed a
Cronbach alpha coefficient of 0.750 for DS knowledge. As the reliability value for the preliminary
pilot testing is at an acceptable level, the real data collection for this study was proceed.”).
Moreover, the assesment the knowledge level of the respondents was mention in the line 102-105
(“The answers to the knowledge survey were measured using correct/wrong/does not know
options measured as 1/0/0. The total score was the summation of the 16 question scores and was
grouped in four categories based on the total score of each respondent: poor (0-4), moderate (5-
8), good (9-12) and excellent (13-16).”)
5. The authors have highlighted several limitations of the study, such as the sampling
method, questionnaire outreach, and potential bias in the responses. They should consider
discussing potential strategies to address these limitations in future studies to provide a
more comprehensive understanding of DS consumption practices and knowledge levels in
Indonesia.
Response: Thank you very much for pointing out this matter. We did provide the strategies to
address this limitation for better future studies as in the line 348-350 (“Thus, more respondents
and better questionnaire outreach are needed to draw a complete picture of the practices and
knowledge level of DS consumption post-delta wave.”)
6. The discussion section could be better organized by separating the key findings and
relating them to the existing literature. It is essential to highlight the novel aspects of the
study and the implications of the findings for policy and practice.
Response: Thank you very much for your suggestion. We divide the discussion part into three
sections: (1) practice of dietary supplement consumption and its predictive factors, (2) knowledge
on dietary supplements and its predictive factors, and (3) limitation and recommendation.
7. Given the study's focus on practices and knowledge levels, it would be helpful to include
recommendations for public health interventions to promote safe and informed DS
consumption, such as educational campaigns or regulatory measures.
Page 23 of 25F1000Research 2023, 12:3 Last updated: 27 JUL 2023
Response: Thank you very much for bringing up this matter. We did include the recommendation
for promoting the safe and informed DS consumption as in the line 358-361 (“Therefore,
collaborative efforts from a multitude of organisations including medical doctors, pharmacists
and governmental bodies to uphold their responsibilities to educate and provide essential and
easily understandable information available to the general public.”) and 364-365 (“This could be
done by increasing accessibility of information with better labelling and educating youth, the
future consumers to empower users to make wise choices on DS.”)
Minor Comments:
8. In several instances throughout the manuscript, the authors use the term ""DS"" without
defining it first. It would be helpful to define the term ""dietary supplements"" before using
the abbreviation ""DS"" to improve readability.
Response: Thank you very much for pointing out this issue. We did define dietary supplements as
DS in the first sentence of the abstract.
9. Some sentences are lengthy and could be broken down into shorter, more concise
statements for better readability.
Responses: Thank you very much for the suggestion. We re-write some sentences to increase the
readability, for example in the line 19-26, 31-36, 222-226, 290-293, 307-311, and 336-342.
10. The manuscript would benefit from thorough proofreading to correct grammatical
errors, inconsistencies in citations, and formatting issues.
Responses: Thank you very much for the suggestion. Our manuscript has been reviewed by a
English native speaker. We do hope it meets your expectation.
11. In conclusion, the manuscript presents an interesting study examining the practices and
knowledge level of dietary supplement consumption in Indonesia during the COVID-19
pandemic. However, several aspects need to be addressed to improve the manuscript's
quality and clarity. By addressing these concerns, the authors can present a more robust
and reliable study that contributes to the understanding of dietary supplement
consumption in the context of the ongoing pandemic.
Responses: Thank you very much for your review. We do hope that our revision does improve the
quality and clarity of the manuscript.
Competing Interests: The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.

Introduction
UnitedStates FoodandDrugsAdministration (USFDA)defined dietary supplements(DS) assubstances containing
vitamins, minerals, amino acids or enzymes, or herb/botanical products that complete the diet's nutritional value.
However,DSisnotintendedfortreating,curing,preventing,ordiagnosingdiseases(FDA,2022).Despitethatdefinition

Ourstudyfoundthat420(77.63%)respondentsconsumedDSduringthepost-DeltawaveoftheCOVID-19pandemic.
Forty percent reported they had never consumed DS before the pandemic. Several sociodemographic factors were
associated with DS consumption, for example, middle-aged adults were more likely toconsume DS compared with
elderly and young adults (p= 0.005). Higher education, higher self-reported economic status, married status, those
diagnosedwithCOVID-19andworkingrespondentswerealsomorelikelytoconsumeDS(p=0.004,0.011,0.000,
0.009,0.000,respectively).NostatisticallysignificantdifferenceswerefoundinDSconsumptionamongsex,domicile

Even though the self-consumption of DS is considered safe, their side effects in high-risk populations, especially
individualswithseveralgeneticbackgrounds,comorbiditiesandpatientsonprescribedmedication,couldbeunpleasant.
Theymightexperienceunwantedeffectsduetodruganddiseaseinteraction(Agbabiakaetal.,2018;Asheretal.,2017;

OurstudyfoundincreasingDSconsumption,asmorethanthreequartersofrespondentsconsumedDSduringtheDelta
waveoftheCOVID-19pandemic,withonly59.52%consumingDSbeforetheoutbreak.Fortypercentoftherespondents

However,ourregressionmodelshowedthatonlyhealth-relatedfieldofworkorstudywasapositivepredictivefactor,

(Ali,2020;Shahbazetal.,2022).MarriedandworkingrespondentsmightconsumeDSduetotheirresponsibilitiesto

Amongthetwogroups,respondentswithnon-health-relatedbackgroundweremorelikelytoconsumeDSformorethan

health-related backgrounds possessed less knowledge about DS, supporting our above-mentioned concern on the
purchasing habits out of drug store. This finding differed from that of 351 students in Saudi Arabia, reporting no
differencebetweentheknowledgelevelofhealthsciencestudentswiththoseofnon-healthsciencestudents(Alowais&
Selim,2019).Unfortunately,mostwerestillpartiallyunawareofthesafetyandsideeffectsofDSonthemarketandthe
necessityofDSconsumption.Thishurdlewasalsofoundamong537UShealthcareprofessionals(Kemperetal.,2003)

Eventhoughsociodemographicfactorsdidnotaffecttherespondents’knowledgeofDS,weneedtobeawareabout
healthinequalitythathasbeenhighlightedduringtheCOVID-19pandemicandhasbeendiscussedextensively(McGrail
etal.,2022;Mishraetal.,2021).InIndonesiaitself,in2017,theWHOandMinistryofHealthRepublicofIndonesia
reported an existing gap on health status in Indonesia related to economic status, education level, occupation,
employmentstatus,age,sex,placeofresidenceandsubnationalregion.Thesedisparitiesincludelowconsumptionof
fruitsandvegetables,knownasthemainsourceofvitaminsandmineralsfromfood(WHO&Kemenkes,2017).These
healthdisparitieswerealsoreportedinseveralotherstudies(Haemmerlietal.,2021;Mulyantoetal.,2019).Dueto
implementing national coverage insurance, health disparities due to differences in economic status have reportedly
decreased(Warsito&Adisasmito,2020).Unfortunately,duringtheCOVID-19pandemic,socio-economicdisparitywas
reportedtoberisinginurbanareas,butdecreasinginruralareaswiththehighestCOVID-19cases,eventhoughitseffect
onhealthinequalitieswasunreported(Brataetal.,2021).
Eventhoughtheinternet-basedsurveywasconductedconvenientlyandefficiently,thequestionnairemightnothave

draw a complete picture of the practices and knowledge level of DS consumption after the pandemic. Despite the
limitations, this study brings an important understanding on the practice and knowledge of DSs consumption in
Indonesia,whichhavereconfiguredourfoodanddietarypsychologyandhabitsduetotheCOVID-19pandemic.
ThisstudyshowedthepracticesandknowledgelevelofDSconsumptioninIndonesiaaftertheCOVID-19pandemic.

The manuscript presents a study focusing on the practices and knowledge level of dietary
supplement (DS) consumption in Indonesia, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic. The
authors have provided a comprehensive background on the topic and presented their findings
based on a well-structured questionnaire. However, there are certain aspects that need to be
addressed to improve the manuscript's overall quality and clarity.
Major Comments:
1. The authors mention that the study was conducted after the COVID-19 pandemic. However,
considering that the pandemic is still ongoing and that the WHO has not revoked the
pandemic status, it would be better to rephrase the context of the study as ""during the
COVID-19 pandemic"" or ""in the post-delta wave of the COVID-19 pandemic"" instead of ""after
the COVID-19 pandemic.""
2. The manuscript would benefit from a clear description of the study design, including the
sampling method, sample size, and the study period. It is essential to provide these details
to assess the study's robustness and reliability.
3. The authors should consider providing a demographic breakdown of the respondents,
including age, gender, geographic distribution, and other relevant characteristics. This
information is crucial to understand the generalizability of the study findings.
4. The authors should provide more details about the questionnaire, including how it was
developed, its validation process, and how the knowledge levels of respondents were
assessed.
5. The authors have highlighted several limitations of the study, such as the sampling method,
questionnaire outreach, and potential bias in the responses. They should consider
discussing potential strategies to address these limitations in future studies to provide a
Page 14 of 19F1000Research 2023, 12:3 Last updated: 21 JUL 2023
more comprehensive understanding of DS consumption practices and knowledge levels in
Indonesia.
6. The discussion section could be better organized by separating the key findings and relating
them to the existing literature. It is essential to highlight the novel aspects of the study and
the implications of the findings for policy and practice.
7. Given the study's focus on practices and knowledge levels, it would be helpful to include
recommendations for public health interventions to promote safe and informed DS
consumption, such as educational campaigns or regulatory measures.
Minor Comments:
1. In several instances throughout the manuscript, the authors use the term ""DS"" without
defining it first. It would be helpful to define the term ""dietary supplements"" before using
the abbreviation ""DS"" to improve readability.
2. Some sentences are lengthy and could be broken down into shorter, more concise
statements for better readability.
3. The manuscript would benefit from a thorough proofreading to correct grammatical errors,
inconsistencies in citations, and formatting issues.
In conclusion, the manuscript presents an interesting study examining the practices and
knowledge level of dietary supplement consumption in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, several aspects need to be addressed to improve the manuscript's quality and clarity. By
addressing these concerns, the authors can present a more robust and reliable study that
contributes to the understanding of dietary supplement consumption in the context of the
ongoing pandemic.

Response to Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author
The manuscript presents a study focusing on the practices and knowledge level of dietary
supplement (DS) consumption in Indonesia, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic. The
authors have provided a comprehensive background on the topic and presented their
findings based on a well-structured questionnaire. However, there are certain aspects that
need to be addressed to improve the manuscript's overall quality and clarity.
Major Comments:
1. The authors mention that the study was conducted after the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, considering that the pandemic is still ongoing and that the WHO has not revoked
the pandemic status, it would be better to rephrase the context of the study as ""during the
COVID-19 pandemic"" or ""in the post-delta wave of the COVID-19 pandemic"" instead of ""after
the COVID-19 pandemic.""
Response: Thank you very much for bringing up this matter. We change the sentences into post-
delta wave of the COVID-19 pandemic as in the line 350 and 354.
2. The manuscript would benefit from a clear description of the study design, including the
sampling method, sample size, and the study period. It is essential to provide these details
to assess the study's robustness and reliability.
Response: Thank you very much for pointing out this issue. We did mention the sampling
methods and the study period in the line 52-55 (“The questionnaire was distributed to the adult
population in Indonesia through email and social media using convenience sampling methods
from October to December 2021, and multiple responds from single device were prevented based
on respondents’ IP address.”); and the sample size in the line 62-65 (“Sample size was calculated
using sample size calculator ( www.raosoft.com) with 5% margin of error, 95% confidence level,
and population number filled with 100,000, resulting in 383 minimum respondents.”).
3. The authors should consider providing a demographic breakdown of the respondents,
Page 16 of 19F1000Research 2023, 12:3 Last updated: 21 JUL 2023
including age, gender, geographic distribution, and other relevant characteristics. This
information is crucial to understand the generalizability of the study findings.
Response: Thank you very much for your suggestion. The sociodemographic characteristic of the
respondents was provided in table 1.
4. The authors should provide more details about the questionnaire, including how it was
developed, its validation process, and how the knowledge levels of respondents were
assessed.
Response: Thank you very much for bringing up this matter. We did mention about the
development of the questionnaire and the validation process as in the line 78-88 (“The
questionnaire was modified from the Prevalence and Awareness Concerning Dietary Supplement
Use among Saudi Adolescents ( Alfawaz et al., 2020) and Knowledge about dietary supplements
and trust in advertising them: Development and validation of the questionnaires and preliminary
results of the association between the constructs ( Karbownik et al., 2019). The questionnaire was
combined and validated by two pharmacologists, a pharmacist, and a psychologist, and was
further tested on 20 respondents to ensure that the content and terms used in the questionnaire
were relevant and understandable. The reliability measurement on the survey data showed a
Cronbach alpha coefficient of 0.750 for DS knowledge. As the reliability value for the preliminary
pilot testing is at an acceptable level, the real data collection for this study was proceed.”).
Moreover, the assesment the knowledge level of the respondents was mention in the line 102-105
(“The answers to the knowledge survey were measured using correct/wrong/does not know
options measured as 1/0/0. The total score was the summation of the 16 question scores and was
grouped in four categories based on the total score of each respondent: poor (0-4), moderate (5-
8), good (9-12) and excellent (13-16).”)
5. The authors have highlighted several limitations of the study, such as the sampling
method, questionnaire outreach, and potential bias in the responses. They should consider
discussing potential strategies to address these limitations in future studies to provide a
more comprehensive understanding of DS consumption practices and knowledge levels in
Indonesia.
Response: Thank you very much for pointing out this matter. We did provide the strategies to
address this limitation for better future studies as in the line 348-350 (“Thus, more respondents
and better questionnaire outreach are needed to draw a complete picture of the practices and
knowledge level of DS consumption post-delta wave.”)
6. The discussion section could be better organized by separating the key findings and
relating them to the existing literature. It is essential to highlight the novel aspects of the
study and the implications of the findings for policy and practice.
Response: Thank you very much for your suggestion. We divide the discussion part into three
sections: (1) practice of dietary supplement consumption and its predictive factors, (2) knowledge
on dietary supplements and its predictive factors, and (3) limitation and recommendation.
7. Given the study's focus on practices and knowledge levels, it would be helpful to include
recommendations for public health interventions to promote safe and informed DS
consumption, such as educational campaigns or regulatory measures.
Response: Thank you very much for bringing up this matter. We did include the recommendation
for promoting the safe and informed DS consumption as in the line 358-361 (“Therefore,
Page 17 of 19F1000Research 2023, 12:3 Last updated: 21 JUL 2023
collaborative efforts from a multitude of organisations including medical doctors, pharmacists
and governmental bodies to uphold their responsibilities to educate and provide essential and
easily understandable information available to the general public.”) and 364-365 (“This could be
done by increasing accessibility of information with better labelling and educating youth, the
future consumers to empower users to make wise choices on DS.”)
Minor Comments:
8. In several instances throughout the manuscript, the authors use the term ""DS"" without
defining it first. It would be helpful to define the term ""dietary supplements"" before using
the abbreviation ""DS"" to improve readability.
Response: Thank you very much for pointing out this issue. We did define dietary supplements as
DS in the first sentence of the abstract.
9. Some sentences are lengthy and could be broken down into shorter, more concise
statements for better readability.
Responses: Thank you very much for the suggestion. We re-write some sentences to increase the
readability, for example in the line 19-26, 31-36, 222-226, 290-293, 307-311, and 336-342.
10. The manuscript would benefit from thorough proofreading to correct grammatical
errors, inconsistencies in citations, and formatting issues.
Responses: Thank you very much for the suggestion. Our manuscript has been reviewed by a
English native speaker. We do hope it meets your expectation.
11. In conclusion, the manuscript presents an interesting study examining the practices and
knowledge level of dietary supplement consumption in Indonesia during the COVID-19
pandemic. However, several aspects need to be addressed to improve the manuscript's
quality and clarity. By addressing these concerns, the authors can present a more robust
and reliable study that contributes to the understanding of dietary supplement
consumption in the context of the ongoing pandemic.
Responses: Thank you very much for your review. We do hope that our revision does improve the
quality and clarity of the manuscript.
Competing Interests: The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.

Introduction
Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder characterized by villous atrophy of the small

depend upon the exposure to dietary gluten or related proteins of rye and barley-dependent symptoms, through
some histopathologic findings (villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia) from a biopsy of the duodenum CD, specific
antibody levels,HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8.4The prevalence of CD isestimated tobeoneto twoindividuals per

evaluatedbasedontheageatdiagnosisofCD,familyhistoryofCD,symptoms(diarrhea,headache,flatulenceand
bloating), comorbiddiseases (food allergies, foodintolerance, othernon-communicable disease). Alongsidethefirst
questionnaire, additional FFQ for caloric and protein intake, calcium, vitamin D and iron intake was addressed to
individualswithCDalongwithquestionsondietarysupplementuse.ThisFFQwasderivedfromtwoLebanese-validated
questionnairestoaddressthequestionsforchildren,adolescentsandadults17,18inwhichasubstitutionof24foodswith
GFfoodswasexecuted(seeUnderlyingdata69).Dietarysupplementusewasassessedthroughpatient’sresponseof
“Yes”or“No”tothestatement:“IusedietarysupplementsinadditiontoGFD”.Toinvestigatethetypeofsupplements
used, patients were asked to answer the following question: “Since you were diagnosed, have you used any of the
followingdietarysupplements?”ThespecificoptionsincludedvitaminD,probiotics,iron,folate,calcium,andvitamin
B12,whicharethecommonlyusedDSamongindividualswithCD.19Thequestionnaireusedinthepresentstudywas

interconsistency(Cronbach-alpha=0.69).Moderatorsoftencommencethefocusgroupbyaskingbroadquestionsabout
the topic of interest, before asking the focal questions. Although participants individually answer the facilitator's
questions,theyareencouragedtotalkandinteractwitheachother.Inaddition,three-dayfoodrecordswerecollected
andanalyzedusingNutritionistProsoftware(version3.2,AXXYA)toassesscaloric,micro-andmacronutrientsintake.
Themeanvalueandthestandarddeviation(SD)wereusedwheninterpretingthenutrient’sintake.
Weightandheightweremeasuredusingautomatedscaleandstadiometer.Bodycompositionincludingbodyfat,lean

Thestandardformulaofbodymassindex(BMI)wascalculatedbydividingweightinkilograms(kg)byheightinmeters
squared(m2).
Laboratoryvalues
AccordingtoastudybyBledsoeetal.(2019),19andMarteauetal.(2001)20albuminandmicronutrientdeficiencies,
includingvitaminsB12andD,aswellasfolate,iron,zincandcopper,arecommoninadultsatthetimeofdiagnosiswith

Discussion
Thisstudy,thefirstofitskindinLebanon,highlightsthenutritionimbalances,P-Emalnutrition,adherencetoGFD,
food-related behaviors and dietary supplements use among participants with CD. Our findings show that 78% of
individualswithCDwerewomen.ThisfindingwashigherthanthedatareportedbyJansson-Knodelletal.,30andAshtari
etal.7whichshowedthattheprevalenceofwomendiagnosedwithCDwas65%between1990and2015andthesero-
prevalenceofCDreportedamongwomenwas165womenoutof2000,respectively.Ontheotherhand,ourfinding

Almost 96% of our population were following a GFD. To assess their adherence to GFD, the examination of the
participant’sthree-dayrecordsreportedlowintakeofgluten(<3gperday)among96%ofthestudyparticipants.Only4%
weren’tadheringtotheGFDrecommendations.Thisfindingwasconsistentwithastudyconductedinindividualswith

while teenagers interrupted their diet purposefully. Parents of pediatric patients with CD from the Slovak Republic,

Asreportedbytheparticipants,somebarriersincludingfamilyignorance(among6%ofthepopulation),languageonthe

and64%ofthestudyparticipantspreparedtheirmeals.Ontheotherhand,almostallthesubjectswereunawareofa
possible cross-contamination during cooking food. Despite 82% of the subjects with CD preferring fast foods, they
frequentlyconsumedtheirmealsathome(92%).Beyondcookingmealsathomeandcross-contamination,ourfindings
were consistent with the findings reported in a recent systematic review indicating that the most significant barriers
limitingtheadherencetoGFDincluded:“lowerknowledgeofCD”(35%);“restaurant/supermarketshopping”(30%);
“poorpatienteducationfrompractitioner”(17.5%);and“lowintention/motivationtoadheretoaGFD(17.5%)”.45

manifestationsamongthemajorityofparticipantsinthecurrentstudy.
Strengthandlimitations
The crucial strength of this study is that it fulfills a comprehensive assessment of dietary intake and food-related
patterns,biochemicalparameters,bodycomposition,andphysicalactivity.However,thisstudyhadsomelimitations:
1)theselectedgroupofpatientsdoesn’trepresentthegeneralpopulationwithCDinLebanon;2)itwasacross-sectional
studyand,thereby,ourfindingsmustbeinterpretedwithcaution;3),physicalactivitylevelswereself-reported;4)thereis
animportantlimitationofdataoncaloric,macro-andmicronutrientcompositionoftherecalledthree-dayrecord.Thelow

Conclusion
Monitoring nutritional status using dietary, anthropometric, blood tests and assessing physical activity are the key
componentsinthemanagementofCD.TheidealGFDshouldbebalancedwithmacronutrientsandmicronutrients,with

Title: Nutritional status, nutrient imbalances, food-related behaviors, and dietary supplements use
among patients with celiac disease in Lebanon: a national cross-sectional study
Opinion
In this manuscript, The authors have investigated the nutritional status, food-related behaviors,
caloric, macro-, and micronutrient intake and dietary supplements use among individuals with CD
in Lebanon. The authors claim, there is no data related to this issue in Lebanon. On a general
search on the web, I did not find any related articles from Lebanon. Hence, I appreciate the
authors for paying attention to the nutritional status of celiac patients living in Lebanon. However,
I have multiple doubts that I am summarising below:
Method
○ In the Selection procedure part: In the ‘exclusion criteria’ the authors mentioned that they
eliminated patients with malnutrition. But in Table 2, they assessed the risk of malnutrition
in the patients with malnutrition. Please clarify it.
○ The line of measurements: ""Weight and height were measured using automated scale and
stadiometer. Body composition including body fat, lean body mass, and visceral fat was assessed
using Bio-impedancemetry body composition analyzer (BF-511, OMRON)"" Please explain the
standardization of measurements.
○ Laboratory value: The authors mentioned the collected data from three different centers.
So, I think, the normal range of parameters could be changed. How did the authors
standardized the laboratory results?
Page 19 of 28F1000Research 2022, 11:725 Last updated: 17 NOV 2023
○ Food-related behaviors and GFD dietary adherence: ""Across the three-day food records,
patients presenting a consumption between 3 to 10 g of gluten per day were considered as non-
adherent"" In this line, please explain how you calculated gluten intake from the diet record?
Which method did you use?
○ Food record calculation: The authors showed the energy and nutrient intake in Tables 4,
and 5, but they don't explain how they calculated this parameter from the diet? Which
program did they use for the calculation?
○ Statistical analysis: The authors did not mention the normality of the data set. How did
they decide the normality test like (t-Test) without checking normality?
○ Please also mention the full form of the SPSS first then give its abbreviation in the brackets
e.g., XXX (SPSS)
Results:
○ In data with a statistically significant difference, please indicate under tables that: 1) Which
test did you use and 2) The cut of point of significant P value (like p<0,05 or 0,001).
Discussion:
○ The discussion part contains multiple repeats of the results. On the other hand, The authors
haven't interpreted the result (Like How, and why ..). For example: What are the factors that
influenced adherence to GFD in Lebanon? Please after comparing the results with other
studies, also give original comments related to your data.
○ Please first write the whole explanation of this term ""P-E malnutrition"" (Protein-energy
malnutrition)
○ ""In our study, the most commonly used DS was vitamin D and the least used one was prebiotics""
The authors mentioned prebiotics, I think it was written by mistake. Please clarify this term
whether probiotic or prebiotic?
○ Villous Atrophy takes place in the small bowel only, no need to specify its location small
bowel. Alternatively, the authors may write, partial to total villous atrophy. (First line of the
main introduction)
○ The first line of the Selection procedure contains results (February to July 2018). Please shift
this in the results section.
Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?
Partly
Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?
Partly
Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?
Yes
If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?
Page 20 of 28F1000Research 2022, 11:725 Last updated: 17 NOV 2023
I cannot comment. A qualified statistician is required.
Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?
Yes
Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?
Yes

Dear Reviewer 3, we modified the original manuscript according to your comments:
Method
○ ""In the Selection procedure part: In the ‘exclusion criteria’ the authors mentioned that
they eliminated patients with malnutrition. But in Table 2, they assessed the risk of
malnutrition in the patients with malnutrition. Please clarify it.""
○ All the patients collected in this study were referred to us by their physicians.
According to their medical files, these patients weren’t malnourished. We
excluded those who were diagnosed by physicians as malnourished patients
because this interferes with our objectives. However, in our study, we were
assessing the risk of malnutrition according to many specific criteria of which
weight loss, albumin….
○ ""The line of measurements: ""Weight and height were measured using automated scale
and stadiometer. Body composition including body fat, lean body mass, and visceral fat
was assessed using Bio-impedancemetry body composition analyzer (BF-511,
OMRON)"" Please explain the standardization of measurements.""
○ Percentage body fat (%BF) was measured by whole-body BIA to the nearest
0.1% using a digital scale/body composition monitor (Omron BF 511, 50 kHz,
500 µA, Kyoto, Japan), which includes an 8-sensor technology using both hands
and feet. The participants stood with bare feet on electrodes on the scale with
their knees and back straight while grasping a handle that also includes
electrodes with both their hands horizontally raised, elbows extended straight,
and maintaining a 90°-angle to the body. A previous study that compared body
composition estimates using BIA devices with DXA and whole body magnetic
Page 21 of 28F1000Research 2022, 11:725 Last updated: 17 NOV 2023
resonance imaging indicated that the use of devices with additional hand
electrodes provides a more accurate prediction of body composition and are
suitable for public use. In order to determine percentage body fat, the device
uses electrical impedance, along with the participant’s height, weight, age, and
gender to generate results. The readings were obtained in duplicates and the
average recorded. According to the manufacturer’s instructions, percentage
body fat was measured two hours or more after breakfast. Omron Healthcare
references for age and gender were used to classify the study participants into
low, normal, high, and very high %BF.
○ We followed these articles: A. Bosy-Westphal, W. Later, B. Hitze et al., “Accuracy
of Bioelectrical Impedance Consumer Devices for Measurement of Body
Composition in Comparison to Whole Body Magnetic Resonance Imaging and
Dual X-Ray Absorptiometry,” Obesity Facts, vol. 1, no. 6, pp. 319–324, 2008.

○ ""Laboratory value: The authors mentioned the collected data from three different centers.

○ For dietary compliance, patients were accurately interviewed by a trained
physician and dietitian to assess the habitual intake of serving of gluten-
containing food per week (e.g. pasta, pizza, bread, or cookies). Compliance to
gluten-free diet was defined as follows: very low = more than one serving of
gluten containing food/week; low = up to one serving of gluten-containing
food/week; good = no gluten-containing food/week. Then based on the three
days record the g/d data of gluten was investigated. We followed the same
methodologies adopted in the below 2 studies:

Generally, the paper is good and informative, although there are some writing and structural
mistakes; these are highlighted and commented on in the attached PDF article. Some long
sentences should be rewritten and separated into short sentences.
○ It is not clear how the intake of gluten was estimated.
○ It is unclear how the weight loss was evaluated; is it in reference to ideal body weight or to
initial weight at the beginning of the study?

It is a very interesting study about nutritional status in CD (celiac disease) patients on GFD (gluten-
free diets) in Lebanon, with many parameters studied. However, I have 2 remarks:
1. Inclusion criteria include celiac disease patients attempting a GFD for at least 6 months. This
should appear in the title of the article (the population is not CD patients at diagnosis but
CD patients on GFD or attempting a GFD). This point should also appear in the abstract
(Background section and Methods section). A very positive point was to evaluate the
adherence to GFD of the patients included, which was high and thus reducing bias.
In the discussion part, some references are inadequate because they studied micronutrient
deficiencies in CD patients at diagnosis, and not in CD patients following a GFD (example:
references 32, 34, 41). These references should be replaced by others, for example: Cardo A
et al, Nutritional Imbalances in Adult Celiac Patients Following a Gluten-Free Diet, Nutrients
2021, 13, 2877.
2. Concerning use of probiotics in CD, there is no strong evidence to date. For this reason, I
think it is better to remove this section in the discussion: ""According to the literature,
gastrointestinal symptoms can be alleviated through prebiotics intake. It has been shown
that Bifidobacterium infantis can alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms if administered to CD
patients before meals for three weeks. This can explain the occurrence and persistence of
gastrointestinal manifestations among the majority of participants in the current study"".
Persistence of symptoms might more probably be explained by associated irritable bowel
syndrome, or by inadvertent gluten ingestion.

Content validation of videos led to improvements in selected activities
and video quality. Expert scrutiny led to further video processing to
include different perspectives of view and speeds of projected

shown in videos and increased distractibility for some participants.
Conclusion: A video catalogue of LL activities was developed and
validated. AOT was deemed safe and feasible for acute stroke
rehabilitation and may be used in future research and clinical practice.

The existing literature on LL AOT mainly uses videos of walking in different contexts. This could be because the

This article describes a study on the feasibility of action observation in lower-limb rehabilitation is
acute stroke. The study is well-written with a simple, clean design.
Is there some evidence for AOT in the subacute and chronic phases?
""It is known that the potential for recovery of motor function is maximal in the acute stage of
stroke."" Could you provide a reference for this?
What videos were the participants shown? Were these only the gait prerequisite videos? If not,
were the patients asked to walk if they were shown videos of people walking? More details are
required for the intervention. Was the intervention done under the supervision of a therapist? Did
the therapists provide any comments or inputs while patients watched the video?
When showing egocentric videos of gait, what is being shown to the participant? The view of the
environment in front of them or their legs? Both of them have problems. Showing the
environment might not allow them to connect it to gait. If the legs are shown, then it's unnatural.
We do not look at our legs while walking. The egocentric view might make more sense for upper
limb activities, but not for the lower limb.
I have a basic question about the AOT modality. Many stroke participants who can benefit from
AOT would see people walk around and do actions with their upper limbs for most of their waking
hours. Why do we believe that a dedicated session of watching custom-made videos would be
beneficial? This question is motivated by the reviewer's lack of a deep understanding of the AOT
literature. But addressing this issue would allow other such readers to fully appreciate the
rationale for the work.
Overall, this is a good study. It can be accepted for publication after the aforementioned issues are
addressed.

Dear reviewer,
Thank you for taking the time to review our article and give your comments to improve the
paper. The modifications done to the manuscript according to your comments are
mentioned below:
Comment 1:
Is there some evidence for AOT in the subacute and chronic phases?
Response:
There already exists evidence for the efficacy of AOT in subacute and chronic stroke. The
reviewer may peruse through the works of Tzu-Hsuan Peng et al (Action observation
therapy for improving arm function, walking ability, and daily activity performance after
stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis), and Deirdre Ryan et al (Effect of Action
Observation Therapy in the Rehabilitation of Neurologic and Musculoskeletal Conditions: A
Systematic Review) for further clarification on the subject.
Comment 2:
Page 12 of 17F1000Research 2022, 11:524 Last updated: 21 SEP 2023
""It is known that the potential for recovery of motor function is maximal in the acute stage
of stroke."" Could you provide a reference for this?
Response:
Thank you for point out this. The required reference in the introduction has been updated.
Comment 3:
What videos were the participants shown? Were these only the gait prerequisite videos? If
not, were the patients asked to walk if they were shown videos of people walking? More
details are required for the intervention. Was the intervention done under the supervision
of a therapist? Did the therapists provide any comments or inputs while patients watched
the video?
Response:
Thank you for the comment. The participants were shown only gait prerequisite videos
(lower limb movements in sitting and lying position). The intervention was undertaken
under the supervision of the treating physiotherapist and comments regarding the
movements watched were also given during the therapy. The details have been added in
the methods section of the article.
Comment 4:
When showing egocentric videos of gait, what is being shown to the participant? The view of
the environment in front of them or their legs? Both of them have problems. Showing the
environment might not allow them to connect it to gait. If the legs are shown, then it's
unnatural. We do not look at our legs while walking. The egocentric view might make more
sense for upper limb activities, but not for the lower limb.
Response:
Thank you very much for the comment and we totally agree for the same. Regarding the
use of egocentric perspective of view, the participants were shown videos lower limb
movements to be performed in lying or sitting positions only (as they had not yet achieved
ambulation capacity). Hence the egocentric videos showed only the legs/ lower body of the
model such that the participant visualizes performing the movement himself. We agree that
egocentric view is more beneficial for upper limb training, but in this instance, we believed
that getting an anatomically congruent view of the movement to be performed would be
beneficial for the participants, as opposed to just the mirror image.
Comment 5:
I have a basic question about the AOT modality. Many stroke participants who can benefit
from AOT would see people walk around and do actions with their upper limbs for most of
their waking hours. Why do we believe that a dedicated session of watching custom-made
videos would be beneficial? This question is motivated by the reviewer's lack of a deep
understanding of the AOT literature. But addressing this issue would allow other such
readers to fully appreciate the rationale for the work.
Response:
The success of AOT relies on the activation of mirror neuron system and mental practice by
the participant. We agree that as the patients see biological movements occurring in their
environment, the MNS must get activated on its own, to certain extent. However, unless
dedicated observation and mental practice of the desired activities is performed (as is true
with learning any new skill), the patients will not attain the required level of functioning.

The authors present a clinical study aimed at developing and validating Action Observation
Training (AOT) videos for lower limb (LL) rehabilitation and testing their feasibility in acute stroke
survivors. Ten patients participated in this study. A video catalog of various LL activities was
created and content validation was performed. The results of this study suggest that AOT can be
safely administered in acute stroke and that these individuals have the ability to understand and
follow the intervention with minimal difficulty.
This novel information is interesting from a clinical point of view. However, some amendments are
suggested to improve the quality of the manuscript:
1. Due to the small sample size of the study the title should clearly mention “preliminary
findings”.
2. It would be helpful to mention in the Introduction that post-stroke ""cognitive impairment"" is
another clinical manifestation of patients with acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (see
and add this reference: Grau-Olivare et al. 20101).
3. It would be interesting to know if the authors found differences in the results obtained in
patients with LL weakness secondary to pure motor hemiparesis, the most common lacunar
syndrome usually due to a small subcortical infarct versus LL weakness secondary to
extensive non-lacunar cerebral infarction or cerebral hemorrhage. Lacunar infarcts usually
have a better spontaneous functional prognosis than other strokes (see and add this recent
reference: Rudilosso et al. 20222).

Response:
Thank you for the comment. The aim of our study was to simply determine the feasibility of
administering action observation training for lower extremity rehabilitation in the acute
stage of stroke. Since our objective was not to find out the effect of AOT on the functional
recovery, it is beyond the scope of this paper. However, we have clarified this detail in the
limitations section of the manuscript for better clarity.

determines disease eradication or persistence in viral populations. We
tested the most sensitive parameters in the basic reproduction

assumption that information (awareness) and non-stigmatization can
stimulate change in the behaviours of infected individuals, and can
lead to an increase in testing and adherence to treatment. This will in

Interpretationofthesensitivityindices
Table 1’s sensitivity indices are read as follows: Positive indices indicate that the corresponding basic reproduction
numberincreases(decreases)asthoseparametersincrease(decrease).Negativeindices,ontheotherhand,indicatethat
increasing(decreasing)thoseparametersreducestheassociatedbasicreproductionnumber(increases).

Reducing high-risk behaviours, primarily through education on the importance of HIV/AIDS status awareness and
treatmentadherence,isthebestoptionforreducingthetotalnumberofHIV/AIDSpatients.
Increased HIV testing is the first step toward UNAIDS’s 90-90-90 objectives, although many countries still face
significantobstaclesinattainingthisgoal.Earlydetectionallowsforpromptantiretroviraltherapy,whichlowersHIV
viral load and hence slows the transmission of the virus. We believe that increasing HIV/AIDS diagnosis rates will

In this paper, the authors developed a new mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of
HIV and AIDS and the model was rigorously analysed. The authors considered the impact of three
major strategies (impact of awareness, testing and follow up) which are important in controlling
the transmission dynamics of HIV/AIDS. The six- compartmental model of HIV/AID presented are:
Susceptible, (S), representing people who prone to be infected with HIV in engage in risk
habits/factors, those who are unaware of their HIV status (HU), those who become aware after
testing (HA), those who are placed on treatment after becoming aware (HT); the AIDS individuals
(AA) due to non-adherence to treatment and the AIDS on treatment population (AT). The author
showed that the model is positive through a given region in their analyses and the reproduction
number of the model was correctly worked out. The effects of the strategies were graphically
represented in the numerical simulations. The title is peaks a volume to the context of the article.
The work is well organized and approved for indexing. I have the following observation/comment
on the paper:
1. The overall command of English looks good, however there are some grammatical errors in
the paper. Also the authors should check for incomplete sentences in the paper.
2. Some representation can be made to reduce the size of the matrices as they are big or
boxes should be adjusted.
3. It is necessary that the biological meaning of R0 be properly stated.
4. In the sensitivity section, the authors can as well placed the real values of the indices.
5. The conclusion looks good, the novelty of the work is discussed.
Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?
Yes
Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?

I have read this article. Some of my critical comments include:
1. Please explore the novelty of this article. What is the difference between this article and
previous research that already exists.
2. I don't see the connection between the existence of the endemic equilibrium point and
basic reproduction number (R0). Likewise to prove the stability of the disease-free
equilibrium. The authors only mention that if R0 < 1 then the disease-free equilibrium is
LAS, while depending on R0 cannot be proven exactly
3. Please also check for proof of global stability of the disease-free equilibrium.
4. The authors must proofread very carefully the language of the manuscript.
5. Carefully check in whole manuscript, dot, and comma after each equation.

6. Then numerical results need to be discussed in more details.
7. The conclusion sections should highlight the main findings of this study.
8. References should be up to date and must follow the style correctly.

The article proposed a mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of HIV and AIDS
considering three control/preventive strategies: the impact of awareness, testing and follow up.
Page 25 of 27F1000Research 2022, 11:1145 Last updated: 27 SEP 2023
The work presented a six- compartmental model of HIV/AID which are Susceptible, (S),
representing people who are likely to become infected with HIV; Unaware HIV infective, (HU),
Aware HIV infective (HA), Treated HIV infective, (HT); AIDS individuals (AA) and AIDS on treatment
individuals (AT). Analysis of the model showed that the model is positively invariant. Also, the
reproduction number of the model was accurately worked out. The stability of the model showed
that the disease free and endemic equilibrium is stable if necessary conditions are satisfied. The
numerical simulations graphically showed the effect of the control strategies. The work is well
organized and suitable for indexing.
However, a few issues should be addressed:
1. The manuscript needs to be properly arranged as some of the matrices are too big. The
boxes should be adjusted.
2. Under stability analysis of the DFE, the R0 is not clearly shown. Since conclusion depends on
the value of R0, it is necessary that R0 is properly substituted in the equation.
3. In the sensitivity section, the sensitivity value need to be presented in order to know how
sensitive each parameters are. The + and - signs are not enough
4. Graphs are not bold enough.
5. Revisit the conclusion under stability of DFE to drive home your findings
6. In figure 5, I suggest that more than two values of ζ be used.
7. In the conclusion, the novelty of the work is not elaborately discussed. Please rewrite this
part to show what the contribution to knowledge is.
8. There should be a paragraph discussing earlier work on diseases such as Ebola, covid-19
and the likes threatening global health. Such articles like, but not limited to 'qualitative
analysis and dynamical behaviour of a Lassa haemorrhagic fever model with exposed
rodents and saturated incidence rate' would help.

Title: the methodology and results sections specify that the study focuses on children 6-59
months old. The title should reflect the same age category.
Results:
○ The study shows no association with exclusive breastfeeding, colostrum feeding. These two
variables are not appropriate in this context, since the methodology section limits the study
to children 6-59 months.
Discussion:
○ The authors don’t discuss thoroughly the differences between their findings and the
literature:
For example:
1. Age of the child was the only factor significantly associated with anemia among children. What
could have been the confounding factors?
2. High prevalence in other studies could be linked to differences in the study population and wider
population coverage since most utilized nationally representative data such as DHS data. What
are these differences?
3. After the statement of high prevalence in other studies, one would expect that the authors
would cite those studies. Instead, they mention Ayoya et al. and
Pita et al whose findings do not reflect high prevalence of anemia.
References:

primary source of the definition of anemia, but only used it.
Reference 3: This policy brief focuses on women of reproductive age, not on children 6-59 months
of age. It may not be relevant here. In fact, it refers to the general WHO definition of anemia,

Innocent Mboya
Dear Mala Ali Mapatano,
We thank you for taking the time to review our manuscript. Below are clarifications and
responses to your comments.
Title: the methodology and results sections specify that the study focuses on children 6-59
months old. The title should reflect the same age category.
Response: We thank the reviewer for this comment. However, we would like the title to be
stated the same way because children 6-59 months still constitute the under-five-year
category. Indeed, previous studies stated the same way even though their target population
was children 6-59 months [1].
Results:
○ The study shows no association with exclusive breastfeeding, colostrum feeding. These
two variables are not appropriate in this context, since the methodology section
Page 14 of 28F1000Research 2022, 9:1102 Last updated: 26 AUG 2023
limits the study to children 6-59 months.
Response: Previous studies established an association between exclusive breastfeeding
with anemia in children 0-6 months. Women in this study were asked whether they
breastfed the child exclusively for six months (regardless of the child’s current age), the
responses being Yes/No, but no association was observed with anemia. As indicated in the
last but one paragraph of our discussion, more studies are necessary to establish a cause-
effect relationship between exclusive breastfeeding and the risk of anemia in children.
Nevertheless, there is evidence that the longer the infant is exclusively breastfed, the worse
the severity of childhood anemia due to low iron content in breast milk [2, 3]. We have also
added this information in the discussion section.
Discussion:
○ The authors don’t discuss thoroughly the differences between their findings and the
literature:
For example:
1. Age of the child was the only factor significantly associated with anemia among children. What
could have been the confounding factors?
Response: Several analyses were performed to determine the factors associated with
anemia among children 6-59 months in this study. Details are also contained in the data
analysis section. Age was the only statistically significant predictor of anemia even after
adjusting for background and nutritional characteristics. We have added this description in
the discussion section.
2. High prevalence in other studies could be linked to differences in the study population and
wider population coverage since most utilized nationally representative data such as DHS data.
What are these differences?
Response: By differences here we refer to the methodological variations in the included
population. Cross-sectional surveys in a small geographical area are likely to give a slight
difference estimate compared to the nationally representative sample such as the DHS. The
first paragraph of the discussion section specifically highlights these issues.
3. After the statement of high prevalence in other studies, one would expect that the
authors would cite those studies. Instead, they mention Ayoya et al. and
Pita et al whose findings do not reflect high prevalence of anemia.
Response: Those studies are cited just before this statement. The sentence citing Ayoya et al
is slightly edited for clarity.
References:
Reference 2: is related to the Tanzania DHS, not to a WHO report. Therefore, the DHS is not
the primary source of the definition of anemia, but only used it.
Response: Reference 2 is the Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey report of 2015/16
and it contains the cited information. These anthropometric measurements were also
Page 15 of 28F1000Research 2022, 9:1102 Last updated: 26 AUG 2023
assessed following a similar methodology documented in this report. In addition, reference
1 cites the WHO document defining anemia in children 6-59 months.
Reference 3: This policy brief focuses on women of reproductive age, not on children 6-59
months of age. It may not be relevant here. In fact, it refers to the general WHO definition
of anemia, without even indicating the cut-off points.
Response: We have removed this citation of the definition of anemia in children under five.

Dear Dr. Indrapal I Meshram,
We thank you for your time in reviewing this manuscript. Please find below our responses
to your recent comments with detailed clarifications.
In method: Under study design, it is mentioned that he study aimed to assess the
nutritional status of children under five years in the district. but in abstract, only anemia
prevalence is mentioned and also title does not reflect this under study population, it is still
not clear how many wards were selected and why systematic sampling was used for
Page 17 of 28F1000Research 2022, 9:1102 Last updated: 26 AUG 2023
selection of HHs.
Response: The current study used secondary data from a community-based cross-sectional study
conducted in the district whose primary purpose was to assess the nutritional status of children
under five years of age. Our analysis focused primarily on anemia and its associated factors
given the high burden of this problem in the region and Tanzania in general.
Under study variable, para 3, it is mentioned reference 2 for WHO reference population, but
reference 2 is not WHO reference.
Response: We acknowledge the reviewer's comment. Please note that reference 2 is the Tanzania
Demographic and Health Survey report of 2015/16 and it contains the cited information. These
anthropometric measurements were also assessed following a similar methodology documented
in this report.
Under statistical analysis, nothing is mentioned about how nutritional status was decided.
Response: We have this information at the end of paragraph 3 of the study variables section
which reads; “Child anthropometric z-scores were calculated using the 2006 WHO child growth
standards through the “zscore06” package in Stata”. This function in Stata software allows the
specification of the child’s height, weight, age, and sex among other parameters for the
calculation of z-scores.
In table 1, single mother is mentioned, how single mother has child, it may be
separated/divorcee of widow, this classification whether used in Africa the prevalence of
underweight mentioned is 6% and wasting 10%, i still have some doubt about this percent
as stunting is 38%. While considering reference in logistic regression, always we consider
good practices as reference, but this is not followed in this table. Age at Complementary
feeding should be below 6 month, 6-8 months and after 8 months and likely analysis should
be done.
Responses:
○ Regarding marital status, it is possible for a single mother to have a child even without
being married. The reason is a woman may choose to have children without any marital
commitment. This classification is not specific in African settings. Existing literature
documents different socio-cultural, economic, and health issues experienced by single
mothers. The contextual definition of single motherhood may differ depending on the area
of application. Some examples are illustrated in these two sources, one which is specific to
Tanzania [1, 2].
○ Regarding the reported results on the anthropometric measures (i.e., wasting, stunting,
and underweight), we would like to indicate that our results are consistent with the
Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey of 2015/16 [3]. The first paragraph of the
discussion section compares the observed results.
○ Regarding Age at complementary feeding, we want to acknowledge the reviewer comment.
However, the reason for having two groups (< 6 months and ≥ 6 months) as shown in
Page 18 of 28F1000Research 2022, 9:1102 Last updated: 26 AUG 2023
Table 2 and 3 is to gain more statistical power as a function of sample size. It can be
seen in Table 2 that there were 163 (30.3%) children initiated complementary feeding
at ≥ 6 months. Breaking this variable further will not improve the results observed in
Table 3 and may increase the probability of committing type I error [4].

Dear Supali,
Thank you for your time to review this manuscript. We have addressed your comments and
suggestions as detailed below.
○ Introduction: needs to be rewritten properly
○ Response: The introduction has been revised accordingly.
○ Methods: It should be written systematically. Example: Data collection for Hb measurement
(anemia) should be separated from collecting questionnaire data.
○ Response: Information about Hb and other measurements has been shifted to the
study variables and measurements section.
○ The rural and urban study areas were not described in detail. There are 27 children from
urban and 575 children from rural (Table 1). What is the definition of urban and rural?
○ Response: As also responded to the first reviewer, Rombo is considered a rural
district of Kilimanjaro region. However, participants were asked whether they
considered the place of their residence as urban or rural. Those who resided in urban
areas were mostly from the district’s centre (mostly referred by locals as urban or
town). The key services such as the district’s commissioner’s office/headquarter,
district hospital, among others are in this setting. In addition, wards are largest
administrative units and contains several villages.
○ Why was the number of urban children only 27 children?
○ Response: Please see the response above.
○ Results: Prevalence of anemia based on age and sex – can be combined in one table.
○ Response: The reviewer response is acknowledged. The figures are much preferred
against tables for better presentation and for the capturing the reader’s interest. This
is also supported by the observed findings in this study where anemia prevalence
differed significantly by child’s age groups.
○ Table 1 and 3 can be combined in one table.
○ Response: Tables 1 and 2 focuses on describing the participant background and
nutritional characteristics. Table 3 contains slightly different information. It compares
the prevalence of anemia by these characteristics and provides results from the crude
regression analysis. For these reasons, we would like to retain the current table
structure.

○ Please rewrite the results systematically
○ Response: The results section has been revised accordingly.
○ Discussion: It is unclear why children below 2 years old showed high prevalence of anemia
compared to 24-59 months children. Please explain in more details.
○ Response: The reviewer comment is acknowledged. The first and second paragraphs
of the discussion section has been revised to clearly explain the observed results,
which also compare with previous studies and shows the public health implications.
○ A question about deworming drugs was included in the questionnaire. What was the
prevalence of STH in the study area? The impact of intestinal helminth infection should be
discussed in this manuscript.
○ Response: Unfortunately, the study did not assess the prevalence of STH which may
be associated with increased anemia risk, which remains an area for future studies.
○ Malaria is prevalent in Tanzania. Why wasn't malaria data included in the study, given that
it contributes to anemia?
○ Response: We thank the reviewer for this comment. Although malaria is prevalent in
Tanzania, not all regions are highly affected. At the regional level, malaria prevalence
is high in the Southern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro compared to the highlands[1].
Secondly, the primary study aim was to assess prevalence of anemia in children
under five in the Rombo district. A more comprehensive study that capture the social-
economic, demographic, behavioral, and clinical determinants of anemia and other
child nutritional-related characteristics is essential in this setting.
○ In general: The manuscript needs major revision.
○ Response: The manuscript has been revised accordingly.

Introduction
1. Globally, about 43% of children under-five are anemic, and there is a marked variation in
the prevalence of anemia between lowand middle-income countries. Over 50% of
anemic children live in low- and middle-income countries 12. There is also a variation in
anemia prevalence within low- and middle-income countries; Repetition of sentence
Under study design and setting
1. No need to give district profile, better to shift under introduction.
2. Villages were randomly selected from a random sample of wards. I think the study was
done in both urban and rural areas, so while using, use both village/wards.
3. How many villages and how many children from each villages/wards were selected is not
clear. Also author has mentioned that the survey was done in villages, then wards also
mentioned, is it a rural ward or urban, whether urban/rural children were selected is not
clear. If so, how these children were selected from urban and rural areas were selected
need to be mentioned.
4. Proportionate sampling should be done in order to give equal representation.
Under Study population, sample size and sampling-
1. It is mentioned that children whose mothers were not available on the day of data collection
were excluded from the study as it was not possible to verify child information if next in kin
or neighbor was interviewed. But in next para, it is mentioned that If the child’s mother was
not at home, the research team visited the house for a minimum of three times before
declaring that the participant could not be reached. This is not matching with above
statement.
2. Ethical para should be written before analysis.
3. Why underweight prevalence is not given when weight has been measured.
4. In table 1, age of child mentioned is 6-26, pl correct 6-23.
5. Table 2, Time at complementary feeding, correct as age at CF.
6. While selecting reference category, positive variable should be consider as reference.
7. Adjusted analysis, which variables were adjusted in regression is not clear, which variable
was removed first should be mentioned.
Under discussion
1. Prevalence in this study is similar to 38.8% among under-five children in Haiti, but higher
than 26% in Cuba. The low prevalence in Cuba was associated to food-fortification
interventions among other strategies.
2. Sentence need to rewrite properly such as study by ----- observed 39% prevalence of
anemia among under 5 year children in Haiti, while study by -------- observed lower (26%)
prevalence of anemia in Cuba which may be due to food fortification being implemented
among this study population. This practice could be one of the factors that leads to poor
anemia status in children, sentence is not correct it is not poor anemia status but low
Page 23 of 28F1000Research 2022, 9:1102 Last updated: 26 AUG 2023
hemoglobin levels.
3. Mothers of children aged 6–11 months in Australia did not receive quality anemia care,
particularly nutrition advice about healthy foods and the minimum acceptable diet to the
care givers- this should not be mentioned here as this study is not in Australia.
4. The high prevalence of anemia among infants in this study is of concern. Interventions such
as iron supplementation, food fortification and dietary diversification and management of
childhood illnesses in this setting should be targeted towards mothers and children less
than two years. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of anemia by sex of
the child in this study which is consistent to findings from other studies- there is no
continuity of statement first sentence should deleted as it is there in last para.
5. Sentence writing needs to be changed, should take help from English speaking person who
can write fluently.
6. From the study, no other factors except age of child was observed significant, other factors
such as type of house, drinking water facility sanitary latrine, morbidities in previous
fortnight or one months if studied would have given more information, no new information
/variable has been found or studied.
Under conclusion
1. Children in this age group were more likely to be anemic compared to those aged 24–59
months-this is of no use in this para first sentence itself is explanatory. In conclusion one
has to mention that there is a need to explore other factors contributing to anemia as IFS
supplementation, morbidities during previous fortnight, sanitary latrine use and mothers
hemoglobin status. In recommendation, it is mentioned IFA supplementation, but whether
these children were supplemented IFA has not been studied although this is universal
program. So recommendation should also be based on the finding of the study.
2. Spelling of complementary feeding should be checked.
In general
1. Discussion needs to be rewritten properly with continuity of sentence.

Dear Meshram,
Thank you for taking time to review our manuscripts. The manuscript has been revised
based on your suggestions as explained below.
Comments:
○ Introduction: Globally, about 43% of children under-five are anemic, and there is a marked
variation in the prevalence of anemia between lowand middle-income countries. Over 50%
of anemic children live in low- and middle-income countries 12. There is also a variation in
anemia prevalence within low- and middle-income countries; Repetition of sentence
○ Response: The paragraph has been revised to avoid repetitions.
○ Under study design and setting: No need to give district profile, better to shift under
introduction.
○ Response: The district profile is briefly discussed here to give a reader the context
with respect to setting where the study was conducted. The background section
focused on describing the problem given the current literature and showing the gap
that necessitated the conduct of this study. For this reason, the district profile fits
best in the methods section than in the introduction. The text has been slightly
revised to avoid repetitions.
○ Villages were randomly selected from a random sample of wards. I think the study was
done in both urban and rural areas, so while using, use both village/wards.
○ Response: Rombo is considered a rural district of Kilimanjaro region. However,
participants were asked whether they considered the place of their residence as
urban or rural. Those who resided in urban areas were mostly from the district’s
centre (mostly referred by locals as urban or town). The key services such as the
district’s commissioner’s office/headquarter, district hospital, among others are in
this setting. In addition, wards are largest administrative units and contains several
villages.
○ How many villages and how many children from each villages/wards were selected is not
Page 25 of 28F1000Research 2022, 9:1102 Last updated: 26 AUG 2023
clear. Also author has mentioned that the survey was done in villages, then wards also
mentioned, is it a rural ward or urban, whether urban/rural children were selected is not
clear. If so, how these children were selected from urban and rural areas were selected
need to be mentioned.
○ Response: Two villages were randomly selected from a random sample of wards.
Also, a systematic random sampling was used to select households. Changes have
been made to in the study population, sample size and sampling to make this more
specific and clearer. Regarding urban vs rural, please see the response above.
○ Proportionate sampling should be done in order to give equal representation.
○ Response: More than half of all wards in the district were included in this study. For
this reason, data from this study are representative of the district population.
However, the findings from this study may not be generalized to other districts in
Kilimanjaro region and the entire country. This has been added in the last paragraph
of the discussion section detailing the study strengths and limitations.
○ Under Study population, sample size and sampling - It is mentioned that children whose
mothers were not available on the day of data collection were excluded from the study as
it was not possible to verify child information if next in kin or neighbor was interviewed.
But in next para, it is mentioned that If the child’s mother was not at home, the research
team visited the house for a minimum of three times before declaring that the participant
could not be reached. This is not matching with above statement.
○ Response: The reviewer comment is acknowledged. The paragraph has been revised
to merge and link this information.
○ Ethical para should be written before analysis.
○ Response: The ethics paragraph has been repositioned.
○ Why underweight prevalence is not given when weight has been measured.
○ Response: Underweight results has been included in the descriptive statistics.
○ In table 1, age of child mentioned is 6-26, pl correct 6-23.
○ Response: Child age categories has been corrected in Table 1.
○ Table 2, Time at complementary feeding, correct as age at CF.
○ Response: Time at complementary feeding changed to Age at complementary
feeding in Age 2 and 3.
○ While selecting reference category, positive variable should be consider as reference.
○ Response: We thank the reviewer for this comment. The initial analysis considered
the positive category as the reference.
○ Adjusted analysis, which variables were adjusted in regression is not clear, which variable
was removed first should be mentioned.
○ Response: Stepwise regression method was used to select variables to include in the
Page 26 of 28F1000Research 2022, 9:1102 Last updated: 26 AUG 2023
adjusted analysis at 10% threshold level. Age of the child remained the only
significant predictor of anemia at this stage. Maternal age, alcohol use (statistically
significant in the crude analysis), sex of the child, and child’s nutritional
characteristics, specifically exclusive breastfeeding, wasting, and stunting were
considered potential confounders, hence included in the final model. This information
has been added in the data analysis section.
○ Under discussion: Prevalence in this study is similar to 38.8% among under-five children in
Haiti, but higher than 26% in Cuba. The low prevalence in Cuba was associated to food-
fortification interventions among other strategies. Sentence need to rewrite properly such
as study by ----- observed 39% prevalence of anemia among under 5 year children in Haiti,
while study by -------- observed lower (26%) prevalence of anemia in Cuba which may be
due to food fortification being implemented among this study population.
○ Response: The sentences have been revised accordingly.
○ This practice could be one of the factors that leads to poor anemia status in children,
sentence is not correct it is not poor anemia status but low hemoglobin levels.
○ Response: The sentence has been corrected.
○ Mothers of children aged 6–11 months in Australia did not receive quality anemia care,
particularly nutrition advice about healthy foods and the minimum acceptable diet to the
care givers- this should not be mentioned here as this study is not in Australia.
○ Response: The sentence has been revised and included the recommended best
practices from this study.
○ The high prevalence of anemia among infants in this study is of concern. Interventions
such as iron supplementation, food fortification and dietary diversification and
management of childhood illnesses in this setting should be targeted towards mothers
and children less than two years. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of
anemia by sex of the child in this study which is consistent to findings from other studies-
there is no continuity of statement first sentence should deleted as it is there in last para.
○ Response: The first two sentences have been deleted to ensure continuity of
sentences in this paragraph.
○ Sentence writing needs to be changed, should take help from English speaking person who
can write fluently.
○ Response: The manuscript has been revised to correct for grammatical errors and
structure of sentences.
○ From the study, no other factors except age of child was observed significant, other factors
such as type of house, drinking water facility sanitary latrine, morbidities in previous
fortnight or one months if studied would have given more information, no new
information /variable has been found or studied.
○ Response: The reviewer comment is acknowledged. Determinants of anemia are
multi-factorial and are likely to differ across settings. The discussion section has also
highlighted numerous other factors that were analysed but had no significant
statistical association with anemia in children. Qualitative and quantitative studies,
Page 27 of 28F1000Research 2022, 9:1102 Last updated: 26 AUG 2023
especially the methods employing longitudinal measurements may be relevant in this
context to determine the factors associated with anemia in children to inform
interventions. This recommendation has been added in the conclusion paragraph.
○ Under conclusion: Children in this age group were more likely to be anemic compared to
those aged 24–59 months-this is of no use in this para first sentence itself is explanatory.
In conclusion one has to mention that there is a need to explore other factors contributing

Conclusion: Prevalence of anemia was lower than the national and
regional prevalence but it still constitutes a significant public health
problem, especially among children aged 6-23 months. Interventions
such as iron supplementation, food fortification and dietary
diversification and management of childhood illnesses in this setting
should be targeted towards mothers and children less than two years.

Dear Supali,
Thank you for your time to review this manuscript. We have addressed your comments and
suggestions as detailed below.
○ Introduction: needs to be rewritten properly
○ Response: The introduction has been revised accordingly.
○ Methods: It should be written systematically. Example: Data collection for Hb measurement
(anemia) should be separated from collecting questionnaire data.
○ Response: Information about Hb and other measurements has been shifted to the
study variables and measurements section.
○ The rural and urban study areas were not described in detail. There are 27 children from
urban and 575 children from rural (Table 1). What is the definition of urban and rural?
Page 13 of 21F1000Research 2020, 9:1102 Last updated: 26 AUG 2023
○ Response: As also responded to the first reviewer, Rombo is considered a rural
district of Kilimanjaro region. However, participants were asked whether they
considered the place of their residence as urban or rural. Those who resided in urban
areas were mostly from the district’s centre (mostly referred by locals as urban or
town). The key services such as the district’s commissioner’s office/headquarter,
district hospital, among others are in this setting. In addition, wards are largest
administrative units and contains several villages.
○ Why was the number of urban children only 27 children?
○ Response: Please see the response above.
○ Results: Prevalence of anemia based on age and sex – can be combined in one table.
○ Response: The reviewer response is acknowledged. The figures are much preferred
against tables for better presentation and for the capturing the reader’s interest. This
is also supported by the observed findings in this study where anemia prevalence
differed significantly by child’s age groups.
○ Table 1 and 3 can be combined in one table.
○ Response: Tables 1 and 2 focuses on describing the participant background and
nutritional characteristics. Table 3 contains slightly different information. It compares
the prevalence of anemia by these characteristics and provides results from the crude
regression analysis. For these reasons, we would like to retain the current table
structure.
○ Please rewrite the results systematically
○ Response: The results section has been revised accordingly.
○ Discussion: It is unclear why children below 2 years old showed high prevalence of anemia
compared to 24-59 months children. Please explain in more details.
○ Response: The reviewer comment is acknowledged. The first and second paragraphs
of the discussion section has been revised to clearly explain the observed results,
which also compare with previous studies and shows the public health implications.
○ A question about deworming drugs was included in the questionnaire. What was the
prevalence of STH in the study area? The impact of intestinal helminth infection should be
discussed in this manuscript.
○ Response: Unfortunately, the study did not assess the prevalence of STH which may
be associated with increased anemia risk, which remains an area for future studies.
○ Malaria is prevalent in Tanzania. Why wasn't malaria data included in the study, given that
it contributes to anemia?
○ Response: We thank the reviewer for this comment. Although malaria is prevalent in
Tanzania, not all regions are highly affected. At the regional level, malaria prevalence
is high in the Southern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro compared to the highlands[1].
Secondly, the primary study aim was to assess prevalence of anemia in children
under five in the Rombo district. A more comprehensive study that capture the social-

economic, demographic, behavioral, and clinical determinants of anemia and other
child nutritional-related characteristics is essential in this setting.
○ In general: The manuscript needs major revision.
○ Response: The manuscript has been revised accordingly.

Introduction
1. Globally, about 43% of children under-five are anemic, and there is a marked variation in
the prevalence of anemia between lowand middle-income countries. Over 50% of
anemic children live in low- and middle-income countries 12. There is also a variation in
anemia prevalence within low- and middle-income countries; Repetition of sentence
Under study design and setting
1. No need to give district profile, better to shift under introduction.
2. Villages were randomly selected from a random sample of wards. I think the study was
done in both urban and rural areas, so while using, use both village/wards.
3. How many villages and how many children from each villages/wards were selected is not
clear. Also author has mentioned that the survey was done in villages, then wards also
mentioned, is it a rural ward or urban, whether urban/rural children were selected is not
clear. If so, how these children were selected from urban and rural areas were selected
need to be mentioned.
4. Proportionate sampling should be done in order to give equal representation.
Under Study population, sample size and sampling-
1. It is mentioned that children whose mothers were not available on the day of data collection
were excluded from the study as it was not possible to verify child information if next in kin
or neighbor was interviewed. But in next para, it is mentioned that If the child’s mother was
Page 15 of 21F1000Research 2020, 9:1102 Last updated: 26 AUG 2023
not at home, the research team visited the house for a minimum of three times before
declaring that the participant could not be reached. This is not matching with above
statement.
2. Ethical para should be written before analysis.
3. Why underweight prevalence is not given when weight has been measured.
4. In table 1, age of child mentioned is 6-26, pl correct 6-23.
5. Table 2, Time at complementary feeding, correct as age at CF.
6. While selecting reference category, positive variable should be consider as reference.
7. Adjusted analysis, which variables were adjusted in regression is not clear, which variable
was removed first should be mentioned.
Under discussion
1. Prevalence in this study is similar to 38.8% among under-five children in Haiti, but higher
than 26% in Cuba. The low prevalence in Cuba was associated to food-fortification
interventions among other strategies.
2. Sentence need to rewrite properly such as study by ----- observed 39% prevalence of
anemia among under 5 year children in Haiti, while study by -------- observed lower (26%)
prevalence of anemia in Cuba which may be due to food fortification being implemented
among this study population. This practice could be one of the factors that leads to poor
anemia status in children, sentence is not correct it is not poor anemia status but low
hemoglobin levels.
3. Mothers of children aged 6–11 months in Australia did not receive quality anemia care,
particularly nutrition advice about healthy foods and the minimum acceptable diet to the
care givers- this should not be mentioned here as this study is not in Australia.
4. The high prevalence of anemia among infants in this study is of concern. Interventions such
as iron supplementation, food fortification and dietary diversification and management of
childhood illnesses in this setting should be targeted towards mothers and children less
than two years. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of anemia by sex of
the child in this study which is consistent to findings from other studies- there is no
continuity of statement first sentence should deleted as it is there in last para.
5. Sentence writing needs to be changed, should take help from English speaking person who
can write fluently.
6. From the study, no other factors except age of child was observed significant, other factors
such as type of house, drinking water facility sanitary latrine, morbidities in previous
fortnight or one months if studied would have given more information, no new information
/variable has been found or studied.
Under conclusion
1. Children in this age group were more likely to be anemic compared to those aged 24–59
Page 16 of 21F1000Research 2020, 9:1102 Last updated: 26 AUG 2023
months-this is of no use in this para first sentence itself is explanatory. In conclusion one
has to mention that there is a need to explore other factors contributing to anemia as IFS
supplementation, morbidities during previous fortnight, sanitary latrine use and mothers
hemoglobin status. In recommendation, it is mentioned IFA supplementation, but whether
these children were supplemented IFA has not been studied although this is universal
program. So recommendation should also be based on the finding of the study.
2. Spelling of complementary feeding should be checked.
In general
1. Discussion needs to be rewritten properly with continuity of sentence.
Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?
Yes
Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?
Partly
Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?
Yes
If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?
Yes
Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?
Yes
Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?
Yes
Competing Interests: No competing interests were disclosed.

Dear Meshram,
Thank you for taking time to review our manuscripts. The manuscript has been revised
based on your suggestions as explained below.
Comments:
○ Introduction: Globally, about 43% of children under-five are anemic, and there is a marked
Page 17 of 21F1000Research 2020, 9:1102 Last updated: 26 AUG 2023
variation in the prevalence of anemia between lowand middle-income countries. Over 50%
of anemic children live in low- and middle-income countries 12. There is also a variation in
anemia prevalence within low- and middle-income countries; Repetition of sentence
○ Response: The paragraph has been revised to avoid repetitions.
○ Under study design and setting: No need to give district profile, better to shift under
introduction.
○ Response: The district profile is briefly discussed here to give a reader the context
with respect to setting where the study was conducted. The background section
focused on describing the problem given the current literature and showing the gap
that necessitated the conduct of this study. For this reason, the district profile fits
best in the methods section than in the introduction. The text has been slightly
revised to avoid repetitions.
○ Villages were randomly selected from a random sample of wards. I think the study was
done in both urban and rural areas, so while using, use both village/wards.
○ Response: Rombo is considered a rural district of Kilimanjaro region. However,
participants were asked whether they considered the place of their residence as
urban or rural. Those who resided in urban areas were mostly from the district’s
centre (mostly referred by locals as urban or town). The key services such as the
district’s commissioner’s office/headquarter, district hospital, among others are in
this setting. In addition, wards are largest administrative units and contains several
villages.
○ How many villages and how many children from each villages/wards were selected is not
clear. Also author has mentioned that the survey was done in villages, then wards also
mentioned, is it a rural ward or urban, whether urban/rural children were selected is not
clear. If so, how these children were selected from urban and rural areas were selected
need to be mentioned.
○ Response: Two villages were randomly selected from a random sample of wards.
Also, a systematic random sampling was used to select households. Changes have
been made to in the study population, sample size and sampling to make this more
specific and clearer. Regarding urban vs rural, please see the response above.
○ Proportionate sampling should be done in order to give equal representation.
○ Response: More than half of all wards in the district were included in this study. For
this reason, data from this study are representative of the district population.
However, the findings from this study may not be generalized to other districts in
Kilimanjaro region and the entire country. This has been added in the last paragraph
of the discussion section detailing the study strengths and limitations.
○ Under Study population, sample size and sampling - It is mentioned that children whose
mothers were not available on the day of data collection were excluded from the study as
it was not possible to verify child information if next in kin or neighbor was interviewed.
But in next para, it is mentioned that If the child’s mother was not at home, the research
team visited the house for a minimum of three times before declaring that the participant
Page 18 of 21F1000Research 2020, 9:1102 Last updated: 26 AUG 2023
could not be reached. This is not matching with above statement.
○ Response: The reviewer comment is acknowledged. The paragraph has been revised
to merge and link this information.
○ Ethical para should be written before analysis.
○ Response: The ethics paragraph has been repositioned.
○ Why underweight prevalence is not given when weight has been measured.
○ Response: Underweight results has been included in the descriptive statistics.
○ In table 1, age of child mentioned is 6-26, pl correct 6-23.
○ Response: Child age categories has been corrected in Table 1.
○ Table 2, Time at complementary feeding, correct as age at CF.
○ Response: Time at complementary feeding changed to Age at complementary
feeding in Age 2 and 3.
○ While selecting reference category, positive variable should be consider as reference.
○ Response: We thank the reviewer for this comment. The initial analysis considered
the positive category as the reference.
○ Adjusted analysis, which variables were adjusted in regression is not clear, which variable
was removed first should be mentioned.
○ Response: Stepwise regression method was used to select variables to include in the
adjusted analysis at 10% threshold level. Age of the child remained the only
significant predictor of anemia at this stage. Maternal age, alcohol use (statistically
significant in the crude analysis), sex of the child, and child’s nutritional
characteristics, specifically exclusive breastfeeding, wasting, and stunting were
considered potential confounders, hence included in the final model. This information
has been added in the data analysis section.
○ Under discussion: Prevalence in this study is similar to 38.8% among under-five children in
Haiti, but higher than 26% in Cuba. The low prevalence in Cuba was associated to food-
fortification interventions among other strategies. Sentence need to rewrite properly such
as study by ----- observed 39% prevalence of anemia among under 5 year children in Haiti,
while study by -------- observed lower (26%) prevalence of anemia in Cuba which may be
due to food fortification being implemented among this study population.
○ Response: The sentences have been revised accordingly.
○ This practice could be one of the factors that leads to poor anemia status in children,
sentence is not correct it is not poor anemia status but low hemoglobin levels.
○ Response: The sentence has been corrected.
○ Mothers of children aged 6–11 months in Australia did not receive quality anemia care,
particularly nutrition advice about healthy foods and the minimum acceptable diet to the
Page 19 of 21F1000Research 2020, 9:1102 Last updated: 26 AUG 2023
care givers- this should not be mentioned here as this study is not in Australia.
○ Response: The sentence has been revised and included the recommended best
practices from this study.
○ The high prevalence of anemia among infants in this study is of concern. Interventions
such as iron supplementation, food fortification and dietary diversification and
management of childhood illnesses in this setting should be targeted towards mothers
and children less than two years. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of
anemia by sex of the child in this study which is consistent to findings from other studies-
there is no continuity of statement first sentence should deleted as it is there in last para.
○ Response: The first two sentences have been deleted to ensure continuity of
sentences in this paragraph.
○ Sentence writing needs to be changed, should take help from English speaking person who
can write fluently.
○ Response: The manuscript has been revised to correct for grammatical errors and
structure of sentences.
○ From the study, no other factors except age of child was observed significant, other factors
such as type of house, drinking water facility sanitary latrine, morbidities in previous
fortnight or one months if studied would have given more information, no new
information /variable has been found or studied.
○ Response: The reviewer comment is acknowledged. Determinants of anemia are
multi-factorial and are likely to differ across settings. The discussion section has also
highlighted numerous other factors that were analysed but had no significant
statistical association with anemia in children. Qualitative and quantitative studies,
especially the methods employing longitudinal measurements may be relevant in this
context to determine the factors associated with anemia in children to inform
interventions. This recommendation has been added in the conclusion paragraph.
○ Under conclusion: Children in this age group were more likely to be anemic compared to
those aged 24–59 months-this is of no use in this para first sentence itself is explanatory.
In conclusion one has to mention that there is a need to explore other factors contributing
to anemia as IFS supplementation, morbidities during previous fortnight, sanitary latrine
use and mothers hemoglobin status. In recommendation, it is mentioned IFA
supplementation, but whether these children were supplemented IFA has not been studied
although this is universal program. So recommendation should also be based on the
finding of the study.
○ Response: The recommendation has been added as suggested.
○ Spelling of complementary feeding should be checked.
○ Response: The spelling errors have been checked and corrected.
○ In general: Discussion needs to be rewritten properly with continuity of sentence.
○ Response: The discussion section has been revised based also on the reviewer
suggestions.

Conclusion
The combination of low-dose Sorafenib with EGCG has a more potential anti-angiogenic effect on liver cancer by
reducing VEGF levels compared to the single standard-dose Sorafenib. It also has similar effectiveness as single
standard-dose Sorafenib in reducing MVD expression compared to the control group. Meanwhile, further study on
the anti-angiogenic effect of low-dose sorafenib combined with EGCG is recommended to evaluate resistance and
Toxicity.

In this study, the authors performed an animal study and double-blind, randomized controlled
trials in 25 Wistar rats (7 weeks old) that were randomly divided into four groups, namely Sham
(K), Control (O), a combination of low-dose Sorafenib and epigallo-3-catechin gallate group (X1),
and standard-dose Sorafenib group (X2). All groups were injected with N-Nitrosodiethylamine 70
mg/kg body weight (BW) intraperitoneally for ten weeks, except the Sham group. After the
development of hepatocellular carcinoma, X1 and X2 were treated for two weeks. They examined
liver tissues and tumor masses for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level and
microvascular density expression and found that there was a significant difference in the level of
VEGF between group X1 (low dose Sorafenib + EGCG) and X2 (Standard dose Sorafenib). However,
the differences in VEGF levels of group X1 and X2 compared to group O(Control) were significantly
lower, with values p=0.000136 and p=0.019, respectively. They concluded that the combination of
low-dose Sorafenib with epigallo-3-catechin gallate is superior in reducing the level of VEGF
compared to standard-dose Sorafenib and is better than the control. Standard-dose Sorafenib and
the combination of low-dose Sorafenib and epigallo-3-catechin gallate have similar effectivity in
reducing the expression of microvascular density and could prevent resistance and lower toxicity
effects.
The study is of interest as it opens a new therapeutic approach based on the anti-angiogenic effect
of low-dose sorafenib combined with EGCG.
The clinical interest relies on the fact that most HCC patients have underlying liver cirrhosis that
may limit the feasibility of antiangiogenic therapy.
However, the authors should recall a similar approach has already been demonstrated with other
low-dose-based treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma such as metronomic capecitabine. In
fact, based on the rationale of the angiogenic effects of prolonged low-dose of therapy, it has
been previously demonstrated that metronomic capecitabine is a safe and effective therapy for
hepatocellular carcinoma patients, as previously reported1,2.

The authors have reported the basic science research regarding the the role of anti angiogenesis
in HCC.
My comments are:
1. In the introduction may be added the recent update in HCC since there are emerging new data
about anti angiogenesis and immunotherapy . may be added also the role of levantinib. Sorafenib
nowadays is not a standard of care for advanced inoperable HCC. Atezo Bev was the standard of
care.
2. Should be added also in the introduction the background rationale for this research since there
are several studies about it already.
3. In the discussion should be added the implication for clinical practice the combination of
experimental drugs. What is the implication for translation research from this data?
4. Advice for further basic research should be added, related to the limitations of this study.
5. In the discussion do not repeat the results, however, compare the results with other studies -
similar results or different results ?

Dear Dr Andree Kurniawan,
Thank you for allowing us to submit a revised draft of our manuscript titled Anti-angiogenic
effect of the combination low-dose sorafenib and EGCG in HCC-induced Wistar rats. We
appreciate the time and effort you have dedicated to providing your valuable feedback on
our manuscript. We are grateful to the reviewer for their insightful comments on our paper.
We have been able to incorporate changes to reflect most of the suggestions provided by
the reviewer. We have highlighted the changes within the manuscript.
Here is a point-by-point response to the reviewer's comments and concerns.
1. In the introduction may be added the recent update in HCC since there are emerging new
data about anti angiogenesis and immunotherapy may be added also the role of levantinib.
Sorafenib nowadays is not a standard of care for advanced inoperable HCC. Atezo Bev was
the standard of care.
Author’s comment: We have incorporated the additional statement in the second last
paragraph of the introduction.
2. Should be added also in the introduction the background rationale for this research since
there are several studies about it already.
Author’s comment: The research rationale has been stated in the 3rd paragraph of the
introduction.
3. In the discussion should be added the implication for clinical practice the combination of
experimental drugs. What is the implication for translation research from this data?
Author’s comment: The combination of low-dose Sorafenib with EGCG has a more
potential anti-angiogenic effect in liver cancer by reducing VEGF values compared to the
single standard-dose Sorafenib. We can advance the research into human, but firstly we
need to examine the toxicity effect in animal research.
4. Advice for further basic research should be added, related to the limitations of this study.
Author’s comment: The advice for further studies has been mentioned in the limitation
section of the discussion.
5. In the discussion do not repeat the results, however, compare the results with other
studies - similar results or different results?
Author’s comment: The comparison with other studies has been incorporated in the 4th
paragraph of the discussion.

1. The abstract
○ Abstract reflects the information of the content. The first statement in the background was
not in line with the texts elsewhere in the content. In addition, the study was not dealing
with the cost and benefit but the efficacy. Then why do the authors put an irrelevant
statement here?
○ The method section in the abstract comprises a brief description of the study design and
PICO. Consider revising.
○ In the results section of an abstract, it is better to provide the interpretation of the findings
in the study rather than providing statistical analysis. In addition, it will be better to put an
attribute (for instance, group I, II, II, and control) rather than X1, X2, confusing the readers.
○ Results session: Please consider using English formatting correctly. English does not use a
comma but a point for decimals.
○ The abstract's conclusion differs from the conclusion written in the body and is not in line
with the study's title and aim, which is focused on the anti-angiogenic effect. Therefore,
consider being consistent with it.
2. Introduction
○ The second paragraph:
○ Are the statement in the first three sentences referred to as the same reference as
the fourth sentence?
○ There is an interplay of some factors, including VEGF inducing cancer - including HCC
- and not solely VEGF. Consider elaborating a little bit regarding this. It does not
matter if the authors solely focus on VEGF.
○ Consistency is essential in scientific publication. Therefore, consider using 'level'
consistently instead of using a different term of 'concentration' or 'values' in this
manuscript.
○ The third paragraph:
○ Is surgery the most common procedure, or is it a primary or definitive procedure?
○ The author stated: ""...while chemotherapy and targeted therapy are also used."" The
question is: Is it 'also used' or is it the protocol for the HCC?
○ The fourth paragraph:
○ Instead of providing information from previous studies reporting improvement in the
prognosis of HCC, the authors should propose the rationale for using this drug to
suppress VEGF.
○ It is essential to answer the question of why use this drug.
○ Authors should provide information on why using the rat model. Particularly the HCC-
induced model.
○ There is no information about using DEN in the background that presents the
transparency of using DEN to induce HCC.
○ Consider providing such information about toxicity and carcinogenesis effect briefly.
Not all readers know about this.
○ The fifth paragraph:
○ The statement was not in line with the structure following the checklist. In addition,
the link provided indicating the ARRIVE checklist is the same as provided in ARRIVE
guidelines https://arriveguidelines.org/ but not specific for this study.
3. Methods
○ Describe systematically and sequentially:
Page 21 of 25F1000Research 2022, 11:289 Last updated: 04 SEP 2023
○ Study design, division of groups in randomization (including randomization process,
random? who did the randomization? what was the instrument used for this
purpose?)
○ Preparation of animals and pre-intervention treatment,
○ Intervention detail in each group,
○ Preparation of materials/materials.
○ Next, the treatment consists of:
○ The carcinogenesis induction process. Who judges the successful induction, and how
did it assess, showing that the intervention was successful? How long does it take to
determine that the induction process was successful?
○ Describe further detail of tumor-induced DEN characteristics that are similar to an HCC.
○ This section does not explain when Sorafenib and ECGC are given. Either immediately or
wait until the HCC induction procedure has been successful. Although, it was explained that
the specimens were taken ten weeks after administering these two drugs.
○ The authors did not describe the specific area of the taken specimen but ‘liver tissue’. Was it
taken from a tumor mass?
○ Describe further detail of method in systematic order.
4. Results. Use the same terminology that commented in the introduction and method. Consider
providing the findings, but not the interpretation.

1. THE ABSTRACT
○ Abstract reflects the information of the content. The first statement in the
background was not in line with the texts elsewhere in the content. In addition, the
study was not dealing with the cost and benefit but the efficacy. Then why do the
authors put an irrelevant statement here?
○ The method section in the abstract comprises a brief description of the study design
and PICO. Consider revising.
○ In the results section of an abstract, it is better to provide the interpretation of the
findings in the study rather than providing statistical analysis. In addition, it will be

line with the study's title and aim, which is focused on the anti-angiogenic effect.
Therefore, consider being consistent with it.
Author’s comment: Thank you for your concern. We have revised the abstract section into a
more relevant statement.
2. INTRODUCTION
The second paragraph:
○ Are the statement in the first three sentences referred to as the same reference as
the fourth sentence?
Author’s comment: Yes, they referred to the same reference.
○ There is an interplay of some factors, including VEGF inducing cancer - including HCC
- and not solely VEGF. Consider elaborating a little bit regarding this. It does not
matter if the authors solely focus on VEGF
○ Consistency is essential in scientific publication. Therefore, consider using 'level'
consistently instead of using a different term of 'concentration' or 'values' in this
manuscript.
Author’s comment: Thank you for your positive feedback. We have elaborated the interplay
factors and revised the ‘concentration’ or ‘values’ into ‘level’ terms.
The third paragraph:
Page 23 of 25F1000Research 2022, 11:289 Last updated: 04 SEP 2023
○ Is surgery the most common procedure, or is it a primary or definitive procedure?
Author’s comment: Yes, surgery is the definitive treatment for HCC if it is operable
○ The author stated: ""...while chemotherapy and targeted therapy are also used."" The
question is: Is it 'also used' or is it the protocol for the HCC?
Author’s comment: Yes, it is the protocol for unresectable HCC
The fourth paragraph:
○ Instead of providing information from previous studies reporting improvement in the
prognosis of HCC, the authors should propose the rationale for using this drug to
suppress VEGF.
○ It is essential to answer the question of why use this drug.
○ Authors should provide information on why using the rat model. Particularly the HCC-
induced model.
○ There is no information about using DEN in the background that presents the
transparency of using DEN to induce HCC.
○ Consider providing such information about toxicity and carcinogenesis effect briefly.
Not all readers know about this.
Author’s comment: Thank you for your considerate question. We have incorporated all the
questions stated above within the manuscript.
The fifth paragraph:
○ The statement was not in line with the structure following the checklist. In addition,
the link provided indicating the ARRIVE checklist is the same as provided in ARRIVE
guidelines https://arriveguidelines.org/ but not specific for this study.

and EGCG in HCC-induced Wistar rats.’ https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6044890.
3. METHODS
Describe systematically and sequentially:
○ Study design, division of groups in randomization (including randomization process,
random? who did the randomization? what was the instrument used for this
purpose?)
Author’s comment: This study was a double-blind, randomized control trial. A laboratory
analyst performed randomization into four groups.
○ Preparation of animals and pre-intervention treatment,
○ Intervention detail in each group,
○ Preparation of materials/materials.
Author’s comment: Thank you for your insightful comments. We have incorporated the
additional statement in the methods section.
Next, the treatment consists of:
○ The carcinogenesis induction process. Who judges the successful induction, and how
did it assess, showing that the intervention was successful? How long does it take to
determine that the induction process was successful?
Author’s comment: An anatomical pathologist from Dr Mintoharjo Naval Hospital
determined the successful induction under the microscope and required ten weeks to
Page 24 of 25F1000Research 2022, 11:289 Last updated: 04 SEP 2023
confirm the accomplishment of the induction.
○ Describe further detail of tumor-induced DEN characteristics that are similar to an
HCC.
Author’s comment: We have elaborated on the similarity of the tumor-induced DEN and
HCC characteristics.
○ This section does not explain when Sorafenib and ECGC are given. Either immediately
or wait until the HCC induction procedure has been successful. Although, it was
explained that the specimens were taken ten weeks after administering these two
drugs.
Author’s comment: Sorafenib and ECGC were given until the HCC induction procedure was
successful by the result from the anatomical pathologist successfully succeeded.
○ The authors did not describe the specific area of the taken specimen but ‘liver tissue’.
Was it taken from a tumor mass?
Author’s comment: Yes, we took the whole liver tissue-contained tumor masses
○ Describe further detail of method in systematic order.
Author’s comment: We have amended the method section more systematically.
We look forward to hearing from you in due time regarding the submission, responses,
further questions, and comments you may have. Thank you.

Abstract
(revision)
view view
Background:
21 Dec 2022
Sorafenib is an expensive standard drug used for advanced
hepatocellular carcinoma. Its combination with epigallo-3-catechin version 2
gallate leads to a reduced cost but equally effective anti-angiogenic
(revision)
effect. Therefore, this study aims to assess the anti-angiogenic effect view
21 Nov 2022
of standard-dose Sorafenib compared to the combination of low-dose
Sorafenib and epigallo-3-catechin gallate.

A total of 25 male Wistar rats (7-weeks-old) were randomly divided
into 4 groups, namely Sham (K), Control (O), combination of low-dose
Sorafenib and epigallo-3-catechin gallate group (X1), and standard- 1. Yefta Moenadjat , Universitas Indonesia,

compared to group O (318,101 ± 55,078) were significantly lower, with
values p=0.000136 and p=0.019, respectively. The expression of
microvascular density between groups X1 (36 ± 4,416) and X2 (26,2 ±
4,55) was not significantly different. Meanwhile, a significant
difference (p<0.05) was discovered when both groups were compared
with group O (176 ± 19).
Conclusion:
The combination of low-dose Sorafenib with epigallo-3-catechin

gallate is superior in reducing the level of VEGF compared to
standard-dose Sorafenib and is better than the control. Standard-dose
Sorafenib as well as the combination of low-dose Sorafenib and
epigallo-3-catechin gallate have similar effectivity to reduce the
expression of microvascular density.

Conclusion
The combination of low-dose Sorafenib with EGCG has a more potential anti-angiogenic effect in liver cancer by
reducing VEGF values compared to the single standard-dose Sorafenib. It also has similar effectiveness as single
standard-doseSorafenibinreducingMVDexpressioncomparedtothecontrolgroup.Meanwhile,furtherstudyonthe
anti-angiogeniceffectoflow-dosesorafenibcombinedwithEGCGisrecommended.

The authors have reported the basic science research regarding the the role of anti angiogenesis
in HCC.
My comments are:
1. In the introduction may be added the recent update in HCC since there are emerging new data
about anti angiogenesis and immunotherapy . may be added also the role of levantinib. Sorafenib
nowadays is not a standard of care for advanced inoperable HCC. Atezo Bev was the standard of
care.
2. Should be added also in the introduction the background rationale for this research since there
are several studies about it already.
3. In the discussion should be added the implication for clinical practice the combination of
experimental drugs. What is the implication for translation research from this data?
4. Advice for further basic research should be added, related to the limitations of this study.
5. In the discussion do not repeat the results, however, compare the results with other studies -
similar results or different results ?
Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?
Partly
Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?
Yes
Page 12 of 20F1000Research 2022, 11:289 Last updated: 04 SEP 2023

Dear Dr Andree Kurniawan,
Thank you for allowing us to submit a revised draft of our manuscript titled Anti-angiogenic
effect of the combination low-dose sorafenib and EGCG in HCC-induced Wistar rats. We
appreciate the time and effort you have dedicated to providing your valuable feedback on
our manuscript. We are grateful to the reviewer for their insightful comments on our paper.
We have been able to incorporate changes to reflect most of the suggestions provided by
the reviewer. We have highlighted the changes within the manuscript.
Here is a point-by-point response to the reviewer's comments and concerns.
1. In the introduction may be added the recent update in HCC since there are emerging new
data about anti angiogenesis and immunotherapy may be added also the role of levantinib.
Sorafenib nowadays is not a standard of care for advanced inoperable HCC. Atezo Bev was
the standard of care.
Author’s comment: We have incorporated the additional statement in the second last
paragraph of the introduction.
2. Should be added also in the introduction the background rationale for this research since
there are several studies about it already.
Author’s comment: The research rationale has been stated in the 3rd paragraph of the
Page 13 of 20F1000Research 2022, 11:289 Last updated: 04 SEP 2023
introduction.
3. In the discussion should be added the implication for clinical practice the combination of
experimental drugs. What is the implication for translation research from this data?
Author’s comment: The combination of low-dose Sorafenib with EGCG has a more
potential anti-angiogenic effect in liver cancer by reducing VEGF values compared to the
single standard-dose Sorafenib. We can advance the research into human, but firstly we
need to examine the toxicity effect in animal research.
4. Advice for further basic research should be added, related to the limitations of this study.
Author’s comment: The advice for further studies has been mentioned in the limitation
section of the discussion.
5. In the discussion do not repeat the results, however, compare the results with other
studies - similar results or different results?
Author’s comment: The comparison with other studies has been incorporated in the 4th
paragraph of the discussion.
We look forward to hearing from you in due time regarding the submission, responses,
further questions, and comments you may have. Thank you.
Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Yefta Moenadjat,
Thank you for allowing us to submit a revised draft of our manuscript. We have adjusted
several texts and sentences based on your highlighted texts. We also attempted to register
the experimental study; however, all animal study registries must be submitted before the
research is done. We sincerely regret this matter, and our evaluation will be for the
following animal study.
We look forward to hearing from you regarding the submission, responses, questions, and
comments you may have. Thank you.
Sincerely,

1. The abstract
○ Abstract reflects the information of the content. The first statement in the background was
not in line with the texts elsewhere in the content. In addition, the study was not dealing
with the cost and benefit but the efficacy. Then why do the authors put an irrelevant
statement here?
○ The method section in the abstract comprises a brief description of the study design and
PICO. Consider revising.
○ In the results section of an abstract, it is better to provide the interpretation of the findings
in the study rather than providing statistical analysis. In addition, it will be better to put an
attribute (for instance, group I, II, II, and control) rather than X1, X2, confusing the readers.
○ Results session: Please consider using English formatting correctly. English does not use a
comma but a point for decimals.
○ The abstract's conclusion differs from the conclusion written in the body and is not in line
with the study's title and aim, which is focused on the anti-angiogenic effect. Therefore,
consider being consistent with it.
2. Introduction
○ The second paragraph:
○ Are the statement in the first three sentences referred to as the same reference as
the fourth sentence?
○ There is an interplay of some factors, including VEGF inducing cancer - including HCC
- and not solely VEGF. Consider elaborating a little bit regarding this. It does not
matter if the authors solely focus on VEGF.
○ Consistency is essential in scientific publication. Therefore, consider using 'level'
consistently instead of using a different term of 'concentration' or 'values' in this
manuscript.
○ The third paragraph:
○ Is surgery the most common procedure, or is it a primary or definitive procedure?
○ The author stated: ""...while chemotherapy and targeted therapy are also used."" The
question is: Is it 'also used' or is it the protocol for the HCC?
Page 15 of 20F1000Research 2022, 11:289 Last updated: 04 SEP 2023
○ The fourth paragraph:
○ Instead of providing information from previous studies reporting improvement in the
prognosis of HCC, the authors should propose the rationale for using this drug to
suppress VEGF.
○ It is essential to answer the question of why use this drug.
○ Authors should provide information on why using the rat model. Particularly the HCC-
induced model.
○ There is no information about using DEN in the background that presents the
transparency of using DEN to induce HCC.
○ Consider providing such information about toxicity and carcinogenesis effect briefly.
Not all readers know about this.
○ The fifth paragraph:
○ The statement was not in line with the structure following the checklist. In addition,
the link provided indicating the ARRIVE checklist is the same as provided in ARRIVE
guidelines https://arriveguidelines.org/ but not specific for this study.
3. Methods
○ Describe systematically and sequentially:
○ Study design, division of groups in randomization (including randomization process,
random? who did the randomization? what was the instrument used for this
purpose?)
○ Preparation of animals and pre-intervention treatment,
○ Intervention detail in each group,
○ Preparation of materials/materials.
○ Next, the treatment consists of:
○ The carcinogenesis induction process. Who judges the successful induction, and how
did it assess, showing that the intervention was successful? How long does it take to
determine that the induction process was successful?
○ Describe further detail of tumor-induced DEN characteristics that are similar to an HCC.
○ This section does not explain when Sorafenib and ECGC are given. Either immediately or
wait until the HCC induction procedure has been successful. Although, it was explained that
the specimens were taken ten weeks after administering these two drugs.
○ The authors did not describe the specific area of the taken specimen but ‘liver tissue’. Was it
taken from a tumor mass?
○ Describe further detail of method in systematic order.
4. Results. Use the same terminology that commented in the introduction and method. Consider
providing the findings, but not the interpretation.
5. Discussion. Use the same terminology that commented in the introduction and method.
6. Conclusion. Use the same terminology that commented in the introduction and method.

Dear Dr Yefta Moenadjat,
Thank you for allowing us to submit a revised draft of our manuscript titled Anti-angiogenic
effect of the combination low-dose sorafenib and EGCG in HCC-induced Wistar rats. We
appreciate the time and effort you have dedicated to providing your valuable feedback on
our manuscript. We are grateful to the reviewer for their insightful comments on our paper.
We have been able to incorporate changes to reflect most of the suggestions provided by
the reviewer. We have highlighted the changes within the manuscript.
Here is a point-by-point response to the reviewer's comments and concerns.
1. THE ABSTRACT
○ Abstract reflects the information of the content. The first statement in the
background was not in line with the texts elsewhere in the content. In addition, the
study was not dealing with the cost and benefit but the efficacy. Then why do the
authors put an irrelevant statement here?
○ The method section in the abstract comprises a brief description of the study design
and PICO. Consider revising.
○ In the results section of an abstract, it is better to provide the interpretation of the
findings in the study rather than providing statistical analysis. In addition, it will be
better to put an attribute (for instance, group I, II, II, and control) rather than X1, X2,
confusing the readers.
○ Results session: Please consider using English formatting correctly. English does not
use a comma but a point for decimals.
○ The abstract's conclusion differs from the conclusion written in the body and is not in
line with the study's title and aim, which is focused on the anti-angiogenic effect.

Therefore, consider being consistent with it.
Author’s comment: Thank you for your concern. We have revised the abstract section into a
more relevant statement.
2. INTRODUCTION
The second paragraph:
○ Are the statement in the first three sentences referred to as the same reference as
the fourth sentence?
Author’s comment: Yes, they referred to the same reference.
○ There is an interplay of some factors, including VEGF inducing cancer - including HCC
- and not solely VEGF. Consider elaborating a little bit regarding this. It does not
matter if the authors solely focus on VEGF
○ Consistency is essential in scientific publication. Therefore, consider using 'level'
consistently instead of using a different term of 'concentration' or 'values' in this
manuscript.
Author’s comment: Thank you for your positive feedback. We have elaborated the interplay
factors and revised the ‘concentration’ or ‘values’ into ‘level’ terms.
The third paragraph:
○ Is surgery the most common procedure, or is it a primary or definitive procedure?
Author’s comment: Yes, surgery is the definitive treatment for HCC if it is operable
○ The author stated: ""...while chemotherapy and targeted therapy are also used."" The
question is: Is it 'also used' or is it the protocol for the HCC?
Author’s comment: Yes, it is the protocol for unresectable HCC
The fourth paragraph:
○ Instead of providing information from previous studies reporting improvement in the
prognosis of HCC, the authors should propose the rationale for using this drug to
suppress VEGF.
○ It is essential to answer the question of why use this drug.
○ Authors should provide information on why using the rat model. Particularly the HCC-
induced model.
○ There is no information about using DEN in the background that presents the
transparency of using DEN to induce HCC.
○ Consider providing such information about toxicity and carcinogenesis effect briefly.
Not all readers know about this.
Author’s comment: Thank you for your considerate question. We have incorporated all the
questions stated above within the manuscript.
The fifth paragraph:
○ The statement was not in line with the structure following the checklist. In addition,
the link provided indicating the ARRIVE checklist is the same as provided in ARRIVE
guidelines https://arriveguidelines.org/ but not specific for this study.
Author’s comment: The ARRIVE checklist is available in the reporting guideline section.

and EGCG in HCC-induced Wistar rats.’ https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6044890.
3. METHODS
Page 18 of 20F1000Research 2022, 11:289 Last updated: 04 SEP 2023
Describe systematically and sequentially:
○ Study design, division of groups in randomization (including randomization process,
random? who did the randomization? what was the instrument used for this
purpose?)
Author’s comment: This study was a double-blind, randomized control trial. A laboratory
analyst performed randomization into four groups.
○ Preparation of animals and pre-intervention treatment,
○ Intervention detail in each group,
○ Preparation of materials/materials.
Author’s comment: Thank you for your insightful comments. We have incorporated the
additional statement in the methods section.
Next, the treatment consists of:
○ The carcinogenesis induction process. Who judges the successful induction, and how
did it assess, showing that the intervention was successful? How long does it take to
determine that the induction process was successful?
Author’s comment: An anatomical pathologist from Dr Mintoharjo Naval Hospital
determined the successful induction under the microscope and required ten weeks to
confirm the accomplishment of the induction.
○ Describe further detail of tumor-induced DEN characteristics that are similar to an
HCC.
Author’s comment: We have elaborated on the similarity of the tumor-induced DEN and
HCC characteristics.
○ This section does not explain when Sorafenib and ECGC are given. Either immediately
or wait until the HCC induction procedure has been successful. Although, it was
explained that the specimens were taken ten weeks after administering these two
drugs.
Author’s comment: Sorafenib and ECGC were given until the HCC induction procedure was
successful by the result from the anatomical pathologist successfully succeeded.
○ The authors did not describe the specific area of the taken specimen but ‘liver tissue’.
Was it taken from a tumor mass?
Author’s comment: Yes, we took the whole liver tissue-contained tumor masses
○ Describe further detail of method in systematic order.
Author’s comment: We have amended the method section more systematically.
We look forward to hearing from you in due time regarding the submission, responses,
further questions, and comments you may have. Thank you.
Sincerely,
Andry Irawan

At the beginning of the results section, the authors stated ""When considering the mean score,
males have higher gait speed, gait cycle, foot speed, and stride length than females, while females
have higher total double support and cadence than males”, but the values (the mean values and
the p values) were not provided. Did the differences reach statistically significant? Again, the
authors should discuss the differences based on the statistical significance.

The study describes the effects of gender, age and obesity on spatiotemporal parameters of gait.
The findings are backed with data and statistical analysis, but they lack logical discussion and a
future direction for the research. The data and procedure of experiment is clearly mentioned but
reproduction and verification of results is difficult as data collection is conducted on specialized
equipment.
The inferences made after research are generalized in nature.

Gait characteristics contain various health information and spatio-temporal parameters have been
recognised as the fundamental descriptions of individuals’ walking patterns. The current research
investigated a total of 45 healthy young adults’ spatio-temporal parameters sub-classified by
gender, age and body mass index. While the study was the important topic, there are some
fundamental concerns to be clarified.
Page 12 of 21F1000Research 2022, 10:266 Last updated: 10 JAN 2023
First, the study seemed to investigate effects of (i) gender, (ii) age and (iii) body mass index on
spatio-temporal gait parameters. However, the total sample is only 45 and there seemed to be
only the healthy young population included in the study. This limited sample may not be sufficient
in leading any meaningful conclusion about age/body mass index effects on spatio-temporal gait
parameters. There are the previous studies that have incorporated much larger samples about
spatio-temporal parameters; therefore, the current study is expected to demonstrate the unique
findings.
Second, the introduction can be improved by elaborating on the three separate discussions about
(i) gender, (ii) age and (iii) BMI effects on gait.
Third, I wonder if there were any inclusion criteria in the study in terms of age. Were participants
recruited widely from the community (e.g., targeting participation of 65+ yrs population)? The
sample population seemed to be limited to the healthy and young.
Fourth, some gait parameters were not defined properly. For example, what was foot speed? Was
it the maximum speed during the swing phase, the average or something else? Similarly, what
was Gait Cycle?
Fifth, tables 2 & 3 should show sample sizes based on the subclassifications (i.e., age, BMI).
Sixth, what was the importance of this study if no significant differences were identified in any
way? Step length or other parameters may possibly reveal gender differences if normalisation
techniques were employed.

participants recruited widely from the community (e.g., targeting participation of 65+ yrs

To recruit the participant an open advertisement was done within the university campus.

I read with interest this research article that addressed the comparison of gender, age, and body
mass index on spatiotemporal parameters of gait.
My main concern is that the authors stated the conclusion not standing on their statistical results.
In the statistical results of this study, there was no difference between gender to spatiotemporal
parameters of gait, however, the authors seem to conclude gender differences exist as like the
previous related articles.
The following provides more specific comments by section:
Abstract
Results: The authors stated, ""Females were found with higher total double support and cadence
than males."" but this is not supported by the statistically significant result.
Conclusion: It's unclear what refers to ""these findings"". It refers to ""no differences for gender”? or
refers to ""females showed higher cadence than males""? The authors should state the conclusion
more clearly and it should be based on the statistical results.
Introduction
In the first paragraph, line 5: I think the authors should distinguish spatiotemporal parameters of
gait (i.e., stride length or cycle time) and stride-to-stride variability parameters of gait (i.e.,
coefficient of variation for stride length or cycle time). The authors did not show any data on the
variability of gait, so this sentence had better remove.
2nd paragraph: Main focus of this paragraph was unknown. In the anterior part of this paragraph,
the authors stated the gender difference in gait parameters, but in the posterior part of the
paragraph, the difference between people who have a disorder and people who did not have a
disorder. With the various topic included in one paragraph, it comes difficult to understand what
the authors want to discuss here, and why the authors try to compare gender differences in
spatiotemporal parameters of gait.

3rd paragraph: Again, two topics are mixed. The former part is about gait and age, and the latter
part is about gait and obesity. I would recommend the authors write a paragraph each topic
separately.
Method
Sample size: Regarding the sample size calculation, isn't the calculation shown here for the sample
size calculation for the correlation analysis? Since this study mainly compared gait parameters
between men and women, I wonder if the authors would be used the expected standard deviation
of the gait parameters for the sample size calculation.
Equipment
More explanation is needed about the measurement using the Physiology 4. What is the
measurement frequency? Where and how is the sensor attached? What kind of gait parameters
are obtained? etc.
Procedure
I do not understand what ""Foot speed"" means. Please explain it in more detail. In addition, the gait
parameters are usually expressed as the combined value of both sides of the legs, especially in
gait speed and cadence. The authors had better show them.
Statistical analysis
The authors are comparing groups by age and BMI, but the criteria for dividing into groups were
unknown. Please clarify how the group was made.
Results
Please delete the sentence like ""Independent sample t-tests were conducted to compare..."". It
should be stated in the statistical analysis section of the methods.
In tables 2 to 4 please show the number of samples by gender, age, or BMI group.
Discussion
In the first paragraph, lines 1-2: I don't think it can be considered a major result because it is not a
statistically significant result. The authors should discuss statistically significant results first. Also,
in the second and third paragraphs, the authors state insignificant results first.
Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?
Partly
Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?
Partly
Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?
Partly
If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?
Partly
Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?

The following provides more specific comments by section:
Abstract
Results: The authors stated, ""Females were found with higher total double support and
cadence than males."" but this is not supported by the statistically significant result.
Changed
Conclusion: It's unclear what refers to ""these findings"". It refers to ""no differences for
gender”? or refers to ""females showed higher cadence than males""? The authors should
state the conclusion more clearly and it should be based on the statistical results.
Changed
Introduction
In the first paragraph, line 5: I think the authors should distinguish spatiotemporal
parameters of gait (i.e., stride length or cycle time) and stride-to-stride variability
parameters of gait (i.e., coefficient of variation for stride length or cycle time). The authors
did not show any data on the variability of gait, so this sentence had better remove.
Removed.
2nd paragraph: Main focus of this paragraph was unknown. In the anterior part of this
paragraph, the authors stated the gender difference in gait parameters, but in the posterior
part of the paragraph, the difference between people who have a disorder and people who
did not have a disorder. With the various topic included in one paragraph, it comes difficult
to understand what the authors want to discuss here, and why the authors try to compare
gender differences in spatiotemporal parameters of gait.
Author wants to highlight the previous differences among gender for gait parameters.

3rd paragraph: Again, two topics are mixed. The former part is about gait and age, and the
latter part is about gait and obesity. I would recommend the authors write a paragraph
each topic separately.
Author separates both paragraphs, one for age effect on gait and another one is for body
composition.
Method
Sample size: Regarding the sample size calculation, isn't the calculation shown here for the
sample size calculation for the correlation analysis? Since this study mainly compared gait
parameters between men and women, I wonder if the authors would be used the expected
standard deviation of the gait parameters for the sample size calculation.
Sample size calculation removed
Equipment
More explanation is needed about the measurement using the Physiology 4. What is the
measurement frequency? Where and how is the sensor attached? What kind of gait
parameters are obtained? etc.
Information added
Procedure
I do not understand what ""Foot speed"" means. Please explain it in more detail.
Separate foot (left and right) speed.
In addition, the gait parameters are usually expressed as the combined value of both sides
of the legs, especially in gait speed and cadence.
Yes, It's true; we measure all the mentioned parameters for both feet. All the outcome
measures are according to the software outcome. For references:

The authors had better show them.
Statistical analysis
The authors compare groups by age and BMI, but the criteria for dividing into groups were
unknown. Please clarify how the group was made.
The age criteria were mentioned in table 3 as age range (18-25) and (30-38)
The Body Mass Index (BMI) groups were classified according to the universal criteria
Underweight (Less than 18.5), Healthy (18.5-24.9), Overweight (25-29.9), and Obese
(Higher than 30).
Results
Please delete the sentence like ""Independent sample t-tests were conducted to compare..."".
It should be stated in the statistical analysis section of the methods.

Please provide more information on the following:
○ How were the participants recruited for this study?
Participants were recruited through an open advertisement within the university campus.
○ Not enough detail regarding Physiolog 4 - please expand on this.
Physilog is a high-quality 3D accelerometer, 3D gyroscope and barometric pressure sensor.
It provided raw 3D acceleration data at a sample rate of 128 Hz. It has an inbuilt SD memory
card to store recorded data. Physilog application for gait was installed on a tablet/computer
and connected with sensors. Stored data were transferred to the computer through the
USB cable.
○ Reliability and validity of the instruments used.
Reference # 21,22.
○ In the procedure: the Detecto scale should be replaced with a stadiometer
cum weighing scale.
Replaced.
○ Provide full details for reference number 22.
Provided.
○ What about flat feet - have you included this in the study?
No, we did not determine flat feet in this study. Our focus was on the gait pattern.
