Aceh comprises predominantly rural areas7, which might result in the skewed distribution of participants\u2019 characteristics, including Education (Senior high school: 47.2%), Occupation (Farmer: 26.7%) and (Suburb: 85.8%). As a result, some conclusions that high educational attainment, working as a private employee, entrepreneur or civil servant (compared to farmers) and residing in a suburb (compared to a city) were associated with higher WTP could not exclude the influence of these skewness distributions. \u00a0 The authors stated that, \u201cPrior to assessing their WTP, participants were provided with an introduction to the Ebola disease including the symptoms and modes of transmission.\u201d Although there were no Ebola cases reported in Indonesia, some respondents were still likely to learn about Ebola and Ebola vaccines in a variety of ways, such as the Internet or newspapers. In addition, knowledge of vaccines had proven to be one of the crucial variables affecting WTP7. Therefore, this intervention would bias the outcome of WTP, which did not reflect the real WTP of respondents.

This is a well-designed study with appropriate methods and explicit results so this paper should be accepted. However, there are minor points that should be clarify to improve your paper. The following are my comments on your manuscript:  The manuscript needs the use of a language editing service. Mistakes in grammar were made, in some cases, even the meaning got lost. \u00a0 The Introduction should be strengthened. I did not see the importance of getting vaccine against Ebola in this part. \u00a0 Although the aim of the study was to \u201cinvestigate community WTP of Ebola\u201d, only patients\u2019 family members were recruited. I think the study subjects did not consistent with its objective. Perhaps, you should consider to change the term \u201ccommunity WTP\u201d into more suitable one. \u00a0 I know you used contingent valuation method to investigate the WTP even though no information provided. I think you should name the method and the technique used for a better understanding. \u00a0 Please give more explanation: how did you set the range of vaccine price? \u00a0 Please give more explanation: why did you collapse participant into three groups of age? Did they have any significance? \u00a0 I do not think you should define all the variables in the section \u201cExplanatory variables\u201d. Readers can find the groups of each variable in the Table. Please be shortened. \u00a0 Please give more explanation: why did you set the cut-off point of 75% to divide attitude and knowledge into \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cpoor\u201d? \u00a0 Please cite the reference for this information: \u201call explanatory variables that had P > 0.25 in this model were excluded from final linear regression model. \u00a0 You said that you had provided information to the Ebola disease prior to assess WTP. I wonder if this step would affect questions regarding the knowledge about Ebola, therefore affect the WTP. Please consider carefully if you still want to state this step on the paper. \u00a0 One of your finding is that higher education associated with higher WTP but the knowledge did not. I think you should give more discussion on this interesting finding. \u00a0 In discussion section, you should state more about benefits of WTP assessment on the economic evaluation. Please add this statement on your discussion: \u201c\u2026WTP is a commonly used method in economic evaluation pf healthcare interventions. In cost-benefit analysis, the WTP method can value both the indirect and intangible aspects of a disease or condition. In cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analysis, WTP is consider to be a reference value to assess if an intervention is cost-effective or not1. It is important to be aware of methodology and interpretation of results because of affecting to decision of policy maker and also affecting in national expanded program in immunization on adding new good vaccines2.\u201d \u00a0 In limitation, you should state that this study did not explore the effects of vaccine efficacy on WTP values. Please add this statement under limitation: \u201cThis study did not explore the WTP difference between two or more scenarios of vaccine with different efficacy. As could be seen in previous study, higher efficacy of vaccines resulted in higher value of WTP3,4,5\u201d ", "guideline_question_answers": [" Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?

However, I am not sure regarding the rationale - although you have\u00a0highlighted this at the beginning of the paper - but even more unlikely currently with travel bans, etc., as a result of COVID-19. This is because I believe Ebola is currently confined to the Congo (and hopefully now reducing) with ongoing steps in the neighbouring countries to prevent the infection spreading. I am not sure therefore of the hypothetical situation regarding Ebola in Indonesia - so good to discuss this more to put the findings into context.  This is because we have seen similar WTP approaches in Brazil for hypothetical and potential vaccines in key infectious disease areas (different to the situation in Indonesia currently with Ebola), with the need to balance the availability of the vaccine against other protective measures - so good to expand on this in the Introduction.

Economic and epidemiological impact of dengue illness over 16 years from a public health system perspective in Brazil to inform future health policies including the adoption of a dengue vaccine. Expert review of vaccines4.  In addition - good to compare the findings and differences in WTP between different groups for the Ebola vaccine in Indonesia and Brazil as both middle income countries. This can include difference in WTP for a vaccine and any potential rationale. This is very different to just concentrating on e.g. US nationals in West Africa - with very different income levels in Brazil - more akin to Indonesia.", "guideline_question_answers": [" Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?
