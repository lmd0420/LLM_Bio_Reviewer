Ten patients participated in this study. A video catalog of various LL activities was created and content validation was performed. The results of this study suggest that AOT can be safely administered in acute stroke and that these individuals have the ability to understand and follow the intervention with minimal difficulty.  This novel information is interesting from a clinical point of view.

The study is well-written with a simple, clean design.  Is there some evidence for AOT in the subacute and chronic phases?  \"It is known that the potential for recovery of motor function is maximal in the acute stage of stroke.\" Could you provide a reference for this?  What videos were the participants shown? Were these only the gait prerequisite videos? If not, were the patients asked to walk if they were shown videos of people walking? More details are required for the intervention. Was the intervention done under the supervision of a therapist? Did the therapists provide any comments or inputs while patients watched the video?  When showing egocentric videos of gait, what is being shown to the participant? The view of the environment in front of them or their legs? Both of them have problems. Showing the environment might not allow them to connect it to gait. If the legs are shown, then it's unnatural. We do not look at our legs while walking. The egocentric view might make more sense for upper limb activities, but not for the lower limb.  I have a basic question about the AOT modality. Many stroke participants who can benefit from AOT would see people walk around and do actions with their upper limbs for most of their waking hours. Why do we believe that a dedicated session of watching custom-made videos would be beneficial? This question is motivated by the reviewer's lack of a deep understanding of the AOT literature. But addressing this issue would allow other such readers to fully appreciate the rationale for the work.  Overall, this is a good study. It can be accepted for publication after the aforementioned issues are addressed.", "guideline_question_answers": [" Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?
