All groups were injected with N-Nitrosodiethylamine 70 mg/kg body weight (BW) intraperitoneally for ten weeks, except the Sham group. After the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, X1 and X2 were treated for two weeks. They examined liver tissues and tumor masses for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level and microvascular density expression and found that there was a significant difference in the level of VEGF between group X1 (low dose Sorafenib + EGCG) and X2 (Standard dose Sorafenib). However, the differences in VEGF levels of group X1 and X2 compared to group O(Control) were significantly lower, with values p=0.000136 and p=0.019, respectively. They concluded that the combination of low-dose Sorafenib with epigallo-3-catechin gallate is superior in reducing the level of VEGF compared to standard-dose Sorafenib and is better than the control. Standard-dose Sorafenib and the combination of low-dose Sorafenib and epigallo-3-catechin gallate have similar effectivity in reducing the expression of microvascular density and could prevent resistance and lower toxicity effects.  The study is of interest as it opens\u00a0a new therapeutic approach based on the anti-angiogenic effect of low-dose sorafenib combined with EGCG. The clinical interest relies on the fact that most HCC patients have underlying liver cirrhosis that may limit the feasibility of antiangiogenic therapy. However, the authors should recall a similar approach has already been demonstrated with other low-dose-based treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma such as metronomic capecitabine. In fact, based on the rationale of the angiogenic effects of prolonged low-dose of therapy, it has been previously demonstrated that metronomic capecitabine is a safe and effective therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma patients, as previously reported1,2.

The abstract  Abstract reflects the information of the content. The first statement in the background was not in line with the texts elsewhere in the content. In addition, the study was not dealing with the cost and benefit but the efficacy. Then why do the authors put an irrelevant statement here? The method section in the abstract comprises a brief description of the study design and PICO. Consider revising. In the results section of an abstract, it is better to provide the interpretation of the findings in the study rather than providing statistical analysis. In addition, it will be better to put an attribute (for instance, group I, II, II, and control) rather than X1, X2, confusing the readers. Results session: Please consider using English formatting correctly. English does not use a comma but a point for decimals. The abstract's conclusion differs from the conclusion written in the body and is not in line with the study's title and aim, which is focused on the anti-angiogenic effect. Therefore, consider being consistent with it.  2. Introduction  The second paragraph:  Are the statement in the first three sentences referred to as the same reference as the fourth sentence? There is an interplay of some factors, including VEGF inducing cancer - including HCC - and not solely VEGF. Consider elaborating a little bit regarding this. It does not matter if the authors solely focus on VEGF. Consistency is essential in scientific publication. Therefore, consider using 'level' consistently instead of using a different term of 'concentration' or 'values' in this manuscript.   The third paragraph:  Is surgery the most common procedure, or is it a primary or definitive procedure? The author stated: \"...while chemotherapy and targeted therapy are also used.\" The question is: Is it 'also used' or is it the protocol for the HCC?   The fourth paragraph:  Instead of providing information from previous studies reporting improvement in the prognosis of HCC, the authors should propose the rationale for using this drug to suppress VEGF. It is essential to answer the question of why use this drug. Authors should provide information on why using the rat model. Particularly the HCC-induced model. There is no information about using DEN in the background that presents the transparency of using DEN to induce HCC. Consider providing such information about toxicity and carcinogenesis effect briefly. Not all readers know about this.   The fifth paragraph:  The statement was not in line with the structure following the checklist. In addition, the link provided indicating the ARRIVE checklist is the same as provided in ARRIVE guidelines https://arriveguidelines.org/ but not specific for this study.    3. Methods  Describe systematically and sequentially:  Study design, division of groups in randomization (including randomization process, random? who did the randomization? what was the instrument used for this purpose?) Preparation of animals and pre-intervention treatment, Intervention detail in each group, Preparation of materials/materials.   Next, the treatment consists of:  The carcinogenesis induction process. Who judges the successful induction, and how did it assess, showing that the intervention was successful? How long does it take to determine that the induction process was successful?   Describe further detail of tumor-induced DEN characteristics that are similar to an HCC. This section does not explain when Sorafenib and ECGC are given. Either immediately or wait until the HCC induction procedure has been successful. Although, it was explained that the specimens were taken ten weeks after administering these two drugs. The authors did not describe the specific area of the taken specimen but \u2018liver tissue\u2019. Was it taken from a tumor mass? Describe further detail of method in systematic order.  4. Results.

My comments are:  1. In the introduction may be added the recent update in HCC since there are emerging new data about anti angiogenesis and immunotherapy . may be added also the role of levantinib. Sorafenib nowadays is not a standard of care for advanced inoperable HCC. Atezo Bev was the standard of care.  2. Should be added also in the introduction the background rationale for this research since there are several studies about it already.  3. In the discussion should be added the implication for clinical practice the combination of experimental drugs. What is the implication for translation research from this data?  4. Advice for further basic research should be added, related to the limitations of this study.\u00a0  5.
