Also, the association of variables including sociodemographics with knowledge and attitude scores was carried out using linear regression analysis. The rationale of the study is sound given the link between COVID 19 infection and vaccination with stroke. Results are clear and organized with acceptable statistical analysis. The conclusions drawn from the findings are appropriate and not overinterpreted. The study is of significance given the findings and the recommendations for educational awareness among the general population and high-risk individuals in the community. However, there is an issue with the population representation.

The authors identified poor knowledge and suboptimal attitudes toward stroke. For a better presentation of the data, it is necessary to clarify the following issues:  It would be interesting to know if there were differences between the young (18-25 years old) and non-young healthy recruits with respect to knowledge and attitudes toward stroke. \u00a0 In the Discussion, it should be noted that in a study on the knowledge of stroke in Catalonia (Spain) it was observed a scant knowledge of cerebrovascular disease in a sample of teenagers.

It is a well-conducted study with scientific merits. This study can be a baseline research for many potential future researchers and hence must be published.  Title: The title should be made simple and clearer. Currently, it is too long and confusing.  Keywords: Need to be alphabetically arranged  Stroke is generally considered to occur in elderly people. However, in this research, the participants are mainly young people/students. Authors need to mention this as a major limitation. This limits the study to generalize the findings to the general public. It would have been nice to focus only on the students rather than the general public in this case.  The Introduction section has to mention more about the probable mechanism of stroke in COVID-19 patients. Authors need to focus more on the topic with more literature added.  It is not clear why authors have chosen \u2018hypertension\u2019 to assume the prevalence of stroke. This needs more explanation.  The questionnaire design is not clearly mentioned in the methodology section. The construct, content, and face validity need to be mentioned in detail. The final questionnaire must be added as an appendix. The authors also need to mention why they developed a new questionnaire rather than adopting an existing one. What is the uniqueness of the newly developed tool? The actual Cronbach alpha value has to be mentioned. The data collection process has to be elaborated. What was the mode of circulation of the questionnaire? How were the subjects chosen?  The discussion rarely mentions about the relationship between COVID-19 and stroke knowledge. Hence some rewriting is needed.  The Conclusion is misleading. How can the authors say the knowledge on stroke is \u2018inadequate\u2019 and \u2018suboptimal\u2019 attitudes? Authors need to first establish the criteria for how they arrived at such conclusions.
