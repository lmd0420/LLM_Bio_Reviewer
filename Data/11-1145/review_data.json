The work presented a six- compartmental model of HIV/AID which are Susceptible, (S), representing people who are likely to become infected with HIV; Unaware HIV infective, (HU), Aware HIV infective (HA), Treated HIV infective, (HT); AIDS individuals (AA) and AIDS on treatment individuals (AT). Analysis of the model showed that the model is positively invariant. Also, the reproduction number of the model was accurately worked out. The stability of the model showed that the disease free and endemic equilibrium is stable if necessary conditions are satisfied. The numerical simulations graphically showed the effect of the control strategies. The work is well organized and suitable for indexing.  However, a few issues should be addressed:  The manuscript needs to be properly arranged as some of the matrices are too big. The boxes should be adjusted. Under stability analysis of the DFE, the R0 is not clearly shown. Since conclusion depends on the value of R0, it is necessary that R0 is properly substituted in the equation. In the sensitivity section, the sensitivity value need to be presented in order to know how sensitive each parameters are. The + and - signs are not enough Graphs are not bold enough. Revisit the conclusion under stability of DFE to drive home your findings In figure 5, I suggest that more than two values of \u00a0\u03b6 \u00a0be used. In the conclusion, the novelty of the work is not elaborately discussed. Please rewrite this part to show what the contribution to knowledge is. There should be a paragraph discussing earlier work on diseases such as Ebola, covid-19 and the likes threatening global health. Such articles like, but not limited to 'qualitative analysis and dynamical behaviour of a Lassa haemorrhagic fever model with exposed rodents and saturated incidence rate' would help.

The authors considered the impact of three major strategies (impact of awareness, testing and follow up) which are important in controlling the transmission dynamics of HIV/AIDS. The six- compartmental model of HIV/AID presented are: Susceptible, (S), representing people who prone to be infected with HIV in engage in risk habits/factors, those who are unaware of their HIV status (HU), those who become aware after testing (HA), those who are placed on treatment after becoming aware (HT); the AIDS individuals (AA) due to non-adherence to treatment and the AIDS on treatment population (AT). The author showed that the model is positive through a given region in their analyses and the reproduction number of the model was correctly worked out. The effects of the strategies were graphically represented in the numerical simulations. The title is peaks a volume to the context of the article.  The work is well organized and approved for indexing. I have the following observation/comment on the paper:  The overall command of English looks good, however there are some grammatical errors in the paper. Also the authors should check for incomplete sentences in the paper. Some representation can be made to reduce the size of the matrices as they are big or boxes should be adjusted. It is necessary that the biological meaning of R0 be properly stated. In the sensitivity section, the authors can as well placed the real values of the indices. The conclusion looks good, the novelty of the work is discussed. ", "guideline_question_answers": [" Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?
