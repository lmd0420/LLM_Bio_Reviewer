As an eye-opener study, any contemplated resolution in the forthcoming will be expected to allow Yemeni nurses continual professional growth while underscoring the knowledge progression from current EN training strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and 'threats' (barriers in clinical practice leadership). Moreover, they will be able to provide and to sustain safe health-care services.  \"Vensim PLE's system dynamics modeling can also be utilized to demonstrate the impact of training on care improvements.\" -- Please remove \"Vensim PLE's\" and then change \"demonstrate\" into visualize.

I am saddened by the findings although it is critical to make everyone know through research dissemination so readers can ruminate on culturally-relevant training and support for nurses, joint policy-making between implementers and surveillance agencies, and exercise of governance for reviewing the standards for patient safety.  Second, the descriptive statistics have underscored\u00a0the reality that met the aims of the study. However, the data distribution could have been indicated and explored for skewness in order to expose the gaps in knowledge distribution. This knowledge distribution may reveal implicit 'disparity' (the access of resources and culturally inflated communicative actions). There is discourse of representation by the data points.  Third, the Chi-square tests and Fisher exact test did work, but if the authors can consider finding causal relationships then it would be a lot meaningful at the level of designing an intervention that targets specific factors/variables.  Fourth, establishing that Yemeni nurses have inadequate knowledge should not only be exploratory rather explanatory. Plans for training improvement must be articulated explicitly. It is clear that the authors just wanted to tell the world about a pervasive problem in Yemen, but the problem is at the healthcare system level. So, it may not only be a case of enteral nutrition.  Fifth, I have these suggestions:  The title will be better if revised to: \"Associated ICU nurses' characteristics to clinical enteral nutrition knowledge in Sana'a, Yemen public hospitals: A basis for remodeling safety and quality of care standards\". \u00a0 The discussion must connect the level of knowledge with (threat to) patient safety and quality improvements required. SWOT analysis is highly suggested. \u00a0 On the other hand, please consider using system dynamics modeling at\u00a0Vensim PLE. Here is a\u00a0tutorial. This can be useful to show the impact of training to improvements in care. This serves as an attractive and alternative modeling. \u00a0 p-value of less than .05 must be statistically significant. \u00a0 This paper should be solution-oriented.

No need to mention the duration of the study under the setting subtitle, it is mentioned under data collection. \u00a0 Delete this \u2018According to Al-Hawaly, Ibrahim, and Qalawa\u2019 and write : according to a previous study(..) \u2026. \u00a0 Instead of citing the tool they have developed and used, authors must mention and cite the references and literature that had been used in developing the tool. \u00a0 Per authors, the second part of data collection instrument contains three subsections which are the before EN administration, during EN administration, and after EN administration. Accepting that this categorization is correct, it is not clear which items are under each subsection. Moreover, most of the 17 items are not related to the before, during, and after EN management, they are related to general knowledge about the EN (such as the indications, goals, benefits, complications, routs, methods, types and contents of EN formula, \u2026\u2026.. etc.), even there is an item asking about the types of nutritional support in general (enteral, parenteral, combination, ..etc.). More suitable grouping and categorizing must be used to organize the instrument or to leave it without any categorization it will be better. \u00a0 Validity and reliability: delete the word \u2018 reliability\u2019 and replace it by \u2018 internal consistency\u2019. \u00a0 Under the data analysis subtitle, they mentioned that a multinomial logistic regression test was conducted.

The authors intended to assess the level of ICU nurses\u2019 knowledge regarding the management of enteral nutrition. The authors recruit 174 nurses in 2019. The authors found that 46% of them had an inadequate level of knowledge regarding enteral nutrition management.

If the authors use the questionnaire which was newly created, how and why the authors could define that a score of 50% or less was considered inadequate, 51\u201375% moderate, while 76% and above was considered adequate.

Based on the results of your study, the only thing the authors revealed was that low SES was associated with inadequate knowledge.
