The literature is quite rich of such papers, showing mutational composition of dystrophinopathy cohorts from different world populations, and these are indeed, as the authors claim, useful for directing local health interventions and policies. However, it would be in my opinion also useful to point out that, in sufficiently large populations, the overall genetic composition of dystrophinopathies tends to be very similar across world populations, as there are no or very few \u201cfounder\u201d mutations (because of the severe phenotype and X-linked nature) and most, if not all identified mutations, usually date back to just a few generations.  Moreover, I have some comments and suggestions, as listed below:  Table 3: Out-of-frame duplications are not amenable to exon skipping. \u00a0 Also skipping of exon 55 for del 56-74 is very theoretical (no dystroglycan binding in the expected protein product). \u00a0 c.6808delT is not a nonsense mutation, but rather a frameshift deletion of 1 nucleotide; therefore a DMD phenotype is expected. The fact that the patient walks at age 9 (with corticosteroid treatment?) does not exclude a DMD phenotype. This patient should not be treated with ataluren. \u00a0 How many of the 43 cases are related cases (siblings, cousins, other)? This point is also relevant for the discussion of de novo frequency in the population (the more siblings, the less de novo). \u00a0 The 12-nucleotide deletion in exon 65 may disrupt binding to \u03b2-dystroglycan, a potential explanation for a severe phenotype despite ORF preservation in this patient. \u00a0 Figure 5 (pedigrees) is not very useful, as X-linked inheritance is expected and always confirmed. \u00a0 \u201cGowers\u201d instead of \u201cGower\u201d. \u00a0 Are the Centers where the data were collected wxclusively pediatric? This may exclude from this population the spectrum of milder BMD which only becomes clinically evident in adult age, and should be considered in the discussion (i.e. underestimation of in-frame mutations). \u00a0 For reference 3 I would suggest Monaco et al. (19881), rather than, or in addition to, the current reference. ", "guideline_question_answers": [" Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?

This the first report from Indonesia on the use of MLPA for the molecular diagnosis of DMD, well-written, and with balance clinical, pathological and molecular data.  There are a few concerns raised:  I believe clinical diagnosis was the basis for patients' inclusion into the study. There are 8 patients without evident deletion or duplication. There should be enough information how these patients were clinically categorized into DMD or BMD or they were simply MD pending molecular confirmation (eg. (a) if the clinical diagnosis/examination was made by qualified neurologist/pediatrician (b) information on dmd22 and dmd26 may be very limited to warrant specific clinical diagnosis of DMD. There was no evident loss of dystrophin in these patients). \u00a0 Page 4 mentioned that databases were accessed on 6 June 2021. It will be worthwhile to have an updated comparison as almost a year has lapsed. \u00a0 Table 1 on the column \"Age when wheelchair\u00a0bound\", it will be clearer to replace \"not yet\" with \"still ambulant\". \u00a0 Table 2 is redundant as the content would have been explained by Table 1. \u00a0 Table 3 and 4 may be combined to focus on discrepancy findings (genotype vs phenotype; IHC vs phenotype).
