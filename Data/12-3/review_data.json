General comments  Method  Questionnaire: more information is needed, especially on the validity tests. What type of validity test was conducted? \u00a0 How do the authors determine the eligibility of the pharmacologist, pharmacist and psychologist to validate the questionnaire? Are 4 reviewers sufficient? Please explain with references. \u00a0 How do the authors determine whether the number of subjects for the pilot study is sufficient? Please add the reference as well. \u00a0 How did the authors determine the level of knowledge based on the score? Were any standard classifications used, (example: Bloom\u2019s cut off point)? Please add the explanation and reference.  Results  Figure 2b describes the results from Kruskal Wallis. But the information on the use of Kruskal Wallis is not described in the method section. Were the data not normally distributed? Please revise accordingly. \u00a0 Table 2 and Table 3. It is not clear on why the demographic data was not included in the logistic regression analysis. Please describe the reason, and revise if needed. Perhaps because it was not significant in the univariate analysis? If yes, then my suggestion is to describe in the statistical analysis, in which to add that the significance variables in the univariate analysis is further investigated using univariate and multivariable logistic regression. Please revise accordingly. \u00a0 Table 2: why are Education, Work and Marital statuses not included into the multivariable analysis even though it is significant in the univariate regression? Why is Field included in the multivariable logistic regression even though it is not significant in the univariate regression?  Discussion  Paragraph 1: It would be good to include the examples of side effects in high risk population, and unwanted effects dur to drug and disease interaction. \u00a0 Paragraph 2: any potential reason for the results of regression model? It would be good to add the explanation on the potential reason. ", "guideline_question_answers": [" Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?

The authors utilized descriptive method of analysis to illustrate the consumption pattern (frequency, duration, aim, preferrable dosage form), familiarity with and side-consequences of DS among the respondents.  This is a well written paper which throws more light on the consumption of DS not only in Indonesia but throughout the world. Other reviewers have commented extensively on the statistical analysis and inferences in this paper. Authors should go over the syntaxes and tenses as I have suggested in the review paper which I am submitting with comments and highlighted sentences or words, LINK.  General Comments:  Introduction:   The subject matter of this manuscript, consumption of DH, is of global concern and the period of study was a time of worldwide pandemic. Currents of vital information on these two issues are vital to the scientific world. The introduction segment of the paper, consisting of four paragraphs, is well written but few sentences therein require correction of typographical errors and tenses. \u00a0 Furthermore, the authors should probably have presented DS consumption from a wider area of the world so that readers could have a better idea of the depth of the health problems that the study was trying to unravel.  Method:  This segment of the manuscript was divided into five segments \u2013 Study design, Participants, Data collection, Ethical consideration, and Analytical procedures. Here, the authors should probably have given a brief description of the study site, including the population of Indonesia and some geographical information, if the sample size was adequate for statistical inference, though this really depends on the response rate as this was an on-line study. \u00a0 One of the minor drawbacks of this section is the syntax of the last sentence in the data collection section which has been referred to and corrected in the review.  Result:  The Result segment of the reviewed paper contains most of the sentences or words that need correction. First, there is no need to express percentages beyond one decimal place. In fact, figures are best expressed as whole numbers. This has been reflected in the reviewed paper. \u00a0 Secondly, some of the sentences in this segment of the paper need to be rephrased to make sense to the readers. One minor observation was that the first column in Table 1 may be re-arranged, putting Marital status and Economic status after Sex followed by Education, Work, Field of work/study and lastly Confirmed COVID-19. \u00a0 Further, Figure 1 is too compact and should probably be spread out and given a relatively clearer explanation, especially Figures 1 C and D. Figure 1 A refers to co-morbidities of the respondents, but this should be explained further. Is it that these disease entities occur together in the same patient (co-morbidity) or they exist differently, in different prevalence, among the study participants? This should be made clear to readers. The following questions in the questionnaire needs further clarification \u2013 Q6: DSs have dangerous side effects and Q10: DS have fewer side effects. The reason is that Q6 does not preclude Q10. DSs fewer but dangerous side effects and fewer or more DSs can have dangerous side effects.\u00a0  Discussion:  It would be good to include references from different regions of the world, including Africa, which was also ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic and where DSs are also consumed in large quantities before, during and after the pandemic. \u00a0 The authors quoted Biesalski\u00a0 & Tinz, 2017 as having a \u201cmiraculous\u201d finding but this word \u2013 miraculous \u2013 should be deleted from this manuscript because it is subjective, and others may not find it miraculous. Some statements in this segment of the manuscript are incomplete and authors have been advised to complete them in the reviewed paper.  Limitation and recommendations:  A statement in the second paragraph in this segment, also highlighted in yellow as others that need correction, has been reconstructed. The authors should take a look at it and possibly effect the recommended changes.  Overall, this is a well-written paper with good ideology. I would like to congratulate the authors for their efforts in producing a splendid work. The authors may wish to go over the reviewed paper and make possible changes to the areas that need correction.

The authors have provided a comprehensive background on the topic and presented their findings based on a well-structured questionnaire. However, there are certain aspects that need to be addressed to improve the manuscript's overall quality and clarity.  Major Comments:  The authors mention that the study was conducted after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, considering that the pandemic is still ongoing and that the WHO has not revoked the pandemic status, it would be better to rephrase the context of the study as \"during the COVID-19 pandemic\" or \"in the post-delta wave of the COVID-19 pandemic\" instead of \"after the COVID-19 pandemic.\" \u00a0 The manuscript would benefit from a clear description of the study design, including the sampling method, sample size, and the study period. It is essential to provide these details to assess the study's robustness and reliability. \u00a0 The authors should consider providing a demographic breakdown of the respondents, including age, gender, geographic distribution, and other relevant characteristics. This information is crucial to understand the generalizability of the study findings. \u00a0 The authors should provide more details about the questionnaire, including how it was developed, its validation process, and how the knowledge levels of respondents were assessed. \u00a0 The authors have highlighted several limitations of the study, such as the sampling method, questionnaire outreach, and potential bias in the responses. They should consider discussing potential strategies to address these limitations in future studies to provide a more comprehensive understanding of DS consumption practices and knowledge levels in Indonesia. \u00a0 The discussion section could be better organized by separating the key findings and relating them to the existing literature. It is essential to highlight the novel aspects of the study and the implications of the findings for policy and practice. \u00a0 Given the study's focus on practices and knowledge levels, it would be helpful to include recommendations for public health interventions to promote safe and informed DS consumption, such as educational campaigns or regulatory measures.  Minor Comments:  In several instances throughout the manuscript, the authors use the term \"DS\" without defining it first. It would be helpful to define the term \"dietary supplements\" before using the abbreviation \"DS\" to improve readability. \u00a0 Some sentences are lengthy and could be broken down into shorter, more concise statements for better readability. \u00a0 The manuscript would benefit from a thorough proofreading to correct grammatical errors, inconsistencies in citations, and formatting issues.  In conclusion, the manuscript presents an interesting study examining the practices and knowledge level of dietary supplement consumption in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, several aspects need to be addressed to improve the manuscript's quality and clarity. By addressing these concerns, the authors can present a more robust and reliable study that contributes to the understanding of dietary supplement consumption in the context of the ongoing pandemic.", "guideline_question_answers": [" Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?
