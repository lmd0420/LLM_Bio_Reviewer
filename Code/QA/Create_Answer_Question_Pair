Overall, the paper tackles an interesting topic, which is comparing the activity monitoring of stroke survivors by physiotherapists and caregivers. While this is a relevant topic and has some merit since caregiver monitoring can potentially be cost-effective and time efficient, however, there are some major concerns that I would like the authors to clarify. More specifically, regarding the methods used. The authors only used 1 day, although I don\\u2019t agree with 1 day being a valid measurement period for 17 stroke survivors. The authors need to strongly justify this, especially due to the subjectivity of rating by both the physios and caregivers and the experience of the caregivers in using the rating tool. In addition to this, there is missing data on observing (i.e. toileting, bathing, testing). The hypothesis of the authors also assumes that caregivers will be there to monitor the patients all day around, which is not always possible.  Abstract  The first line of the conclusion \\\"There was moderate agreement between the physiotherapist and caregiver for activity monitoring of stroke survivors\\\" is rather a result than a conclusion. I suggest the authors rephrase the conclusion to conclude the overall outcome of their study.   Introduction  In the first paragraph, the authors write about the global and European prevalence of stroke. While this is good, I suggest the authors also add about the prevalence of stroke in India, since this is where the study was conducted. \\u00a0 In the second paragraph, the authors address the physical (in)activity of people with stroke during inpatient rehab. Are there any recommendations for PA during this period for stroke survivors? i.e. number of steps per day or min spent in different PA levels for example? \\u00a0 In the third paragraph, the authors briefly touch on the behavioral mapping tool. I think this paragraph could be strengthened by expanding on this tool, i.e., what does it consist of? Also, the authors need to address previous studies that have used this tool in people with stroke, what have they found? Are there previous studies that have done something like your study?   Methods In the 'Eligibility criteria' paragraph:  Can the authors give examples of who the caregivers could be? \\u00a0 Also, can the authors first list all the inclusion criteria and then list the exclusion criteria? Was understanding or previous experience of the activity log an inclusion criterion?   In the 'Outcome' paragraph:  Did the caregivers or the physios get any training on using the activity log? \\u00a0 The authors mention that \\\"the log chart was sent to 15 experts for validation\\\". How was this done? Who were the experts?   Procedure  The authors mention that \\\"The observations were carried out every 15 min\\\".\\u00a0What happened when the caregivers or physios had to take a break i.e. go to the toilet or lunch break? \\u00a0 Is one day enough to make an overall conclusion? The authors need to strongly justify why they only did 1 day of measurements.   Results  Figure 1, can the authors separate (group) the different activities into the 3 different domains i.e. physical, cognitive and social? Therefore, it would be easier to see which of these domains had the best agreement or the worst. \\u00a0 It would also be interesting to look at the agreement over the course of the day. For example, did the accuracy decrease over the day i.e., did the raters get tired of observing the people with stroke?   Discussion  The discussion lacks comparison to other studies that conducted similar observations. What did they find compared to your results? \\u00a0 Have the authors thought about using accelerometry to measure activity? Although the accelerometry might not be able to yield the exact activity being done, it could give an overall PA output, which could be a good marker for measuring changes in activity levels. I think this is worth a mention in the discussion. \\u00a0 Although I think one can't really draw any conclusion from 1 day of observations,\\u00a0what does it mean clinically that there is a 60% agreement between the physiotherapist and the caregivers? Is this enough? What can be done to increase this agreement? Is this a future valid technique? \\u00a0 One of the possible clinical implications of this study is if the caregivers don't want to participate in the activity logging. Maybe they just want to be present and support the person affected by stroke. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 This paper does not have an overall conclusion. \",\n","            \"guideline_question_answers\": [\n","                \" Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?

The paper might provide evidence about an alternative option to address activity monitoring in the clinical setting by caregivers (especially in some activities such as bathing and dressing), as this could be time-consuming for healthcare professionals.

The study's results tackle a persistent challenge in literature, namely the monitoring of physical and other activities in clinical populations, offering a novel solution. For this reason, I believe these findings should be considered for indexing. However, I would like to recommend significant modifications to enhance the scientific rigor of the study. The current results are presented too strongly given the design and sample size. I suggest toning down the findings, emphasizing the pilot and feasibility testing component of the study, and engaging in a critical discussion on how these results can inform the design of caregiver-monitored activity logs during early-phase stroke rehabilitation.  Title:  Consider adding \\\"Pilot\\\" to the title due to the sample size.   Abstract: Well-written, minor suggestions:  Consider adding \\\"early phase\\\" before \\\"hospital settings\\\" to distinguish from outpatient rehabilitation. \\u00a0 Insert \\\"across one day\\\" before \\\"every 15 minutes\\\" for clarity. \\u00a0 Include brief demographics for physiotherapists as participants.    Introduction: Paragraph 1: Please incorporate stroke statistics specific to India to substantiate the study's relevance. Utilize percentages to illustrate the impact, particularly when stating that \\\"stroke survivors have significantly reduced activity levels.\\\"  Define \\\"early phase\\\" at the outset to enhance the paper's readability.  Paragraph 2:  Expand on the benefits of increased activity during the acute phase of stroke recovery and delineate the factors that limit activity, especially in the post-acute phase.  Paragraph 3:  Briefly talk about the different tools used for behavioural mapping such as video recording, checklists, wearable devices etc., with a brief discussion on pros and cons for each method. Please justify why you selected checklist/log. \\u00a0  Methods: Inclusion criteria:   \\u201cFunctionally communicate\\u201d has been used twice in the paragraph.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Include the inclusion criteria for physiotherapists, specifying their level of expertise (e.g., trained neurophysiotherapists, novice clinicians, experienced clinicians) to provide context on their participation and qualifications in the study.   Outcome:  Elaborate on the process of developing the activity log, specifying whether the validation involved face validation or content validation, to enhance the clarity and rigor of the log development. \\u00a0 Specify whether the testing involving 20 stroke patients was related to assessing the practicality and usability of the log. This clarification will provide a better understanding of the purpose and focus of the testing phase. \\u00a0 Finally, explain why exercise was categorized separately from therapies in the activity log. Given that therapies often encompass exercise in the early phase, clarify the rationale for this distinction and consider discussing how this categorization may have contributed to any discrepancies observed between physiotherapists and caregivers.   Procedure:  Clarify whether the intern-to-patient ratio was 1:1 or if the intern monitored more than one patient on a particular day. Specify the procedure for patient monitoring when the intern had to take a break. \\u00a0 Indicate whether caregivers were provided with reminders or prompts every 15 minutes during the monitoring process. \\u00a0 Provide a rationale for selecting only one working day for agreement testing.   Statistical Analysis:  Due to the limited sample size in this study, it is important to provide a justification for the chosen sample size. Include information regarding whether a power analysis was conducted. \\u00a0 I believe the study lacks sufficient statistical power for utilizing multi-rater kappa, a concern that is indeed emphasized in the discussion. It might be worth considering excluding these specific findings.   Results:  Integrate relevant details about the physiotherapists into the tables or corresponding paragraphs within the Results section. \\u00a0 Organizing the kappa agreement according to the three domains of activities in Figure 1 would be beneficial. This would offer insights into the level of agreement within each domain, allowing for a comparison of agreement quality across the domains.   Discussion: Overall, the authors effectively emphasize the feasibility of utilizing caregiver led activity logs and underscore how the design of the activity log can impact agreement. However, enhancing the discussion through a more critical comparison with existing studies would further bolster the strength of the argument.  Here are some suggestions for the discussion:  Draw parallels with the fundamental concepts of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and elaborate on how periodic reminders every 15 minutes could have impacted the reporting within this study. \\u00a0 Compare the role of caregiver burden and recall burden in subjective reporting studies conducted in similar and other clinical populations. \\u00a0 Address the learning curve associated with reporting multiple activities by caregivers. The limited reporting duration in this single-day study may not have allowed caregivers to fully grasp the intricacies of reporting various activities, especially if a change in caregivers occurred during the day. \\u00a0 A discussion on alternative activity tracking methods, such as wearable sensors, should have been included. \\u00a0 Include a discussion of the rationale behind selecting specific activities, particularly during the initial phase, and its influence on the reporting process. For instance, considering that physiotherapists were unable to access the bathroom area, consolidating toileting-related activities into a single category could ensure equal reporting opportunities for both physiotherapists and caregivers. Likewise, it is anticipated that patients would undergo clinical monitoring and testing early in their recovery phase. Future studies may consider incorporating this aspect into the activity log to mitigate discrepancies related to this particular activity. \",\n","            \"guideline_question_answers\": [\n","                \" Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?
